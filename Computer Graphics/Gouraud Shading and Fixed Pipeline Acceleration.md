The Phong model computations of Gouraud shading is performed at the vertices, and then interpolated across the surface. This is in contrast to [[Phong Shading|Phong shading]], by which per-pixel calculations are performed. (<u>2</u>)

This method is simple enough to be calculated by fixed pipeline. (<u>1</u>)
