In [[Cohen-Sutherland Algorithm]], we see how to clip a single line. But, often the object that we need to display is a **polygon**.

Clipping polygons are **more complicated**, and we have many different methods. For example, using multiple **convex polygons** to simple this process.

Following are the list of methods we can use:

- [[Tessellation and Convexity]]
- [[Sutherland-Hodgman Algorithm]]
- [[Cohen-Sutherland Algorithm#Cohen-Sutherland Method in 3D]]
