The GLSL pipeline is demonstrated in the figure below:

To write GLSL programs for [[Shader|shaders]], the programs are **separated from the main program**. The programs are usually saved with post-fix `.vs` or `.vert` for [[Vertex Shader|vertex shader]], and `.fs` or `.frag` for [[Fragment Shader|fragment shader]].

Note that you can use **multiple different shader codes** for different textures.
