The first and second moment of a probability network is defined as: (<u>1</u>)

$$
\left\{
	\begin{array}{}
		\langle k \rangle &=&
		\displaystyle
		\sum_{k = 0}^\infty kp^k \\
		\langle k^2 \rangle &=&
		\displaystyle
		\sum_{k = 0}^{\infty}
		k^2 p^k
	\end{array}
\right.
$$

In the figure below, it shows the plot of [[Random Graph|random graph's]] degree distribution (in green) and the plot of [[Scale-free Network|scale-free network's]] degree distribution (in purple). (<u>1</u>)

If the network is [[Random Graph|random graph]], the moment can tell us **most nodes' degree**. Unfortunately, for [[Scale-free Network|scale-free network]], it doesn't tell us anything.
