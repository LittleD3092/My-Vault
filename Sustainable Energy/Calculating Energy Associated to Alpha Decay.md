To calculate the energy associated to the alpha decay, we calculate the mass difference and use mass-energy equivalence. (<u>1, 2</u>)

$$E = m_{\rm difference} \cdot c^2$$

- $E$: Energy.
- $m_{\rm difference}$: The mass difference of left-hand side and right-hand side of the chemical reaction.
- $c$: The speed of light.

# Example

Calculate the total energy associated with the reaction:

$$\rm {}^{241} Am \longrightarrow {}^{237} Np + \alpha$$

if the mass:

- $\rm {}^4 He$: $4.00260325 \rm \ u$
- ${}^{241}\rm Am$: $241.0568229 \ \rm u$
- $\rm {}^{237} Np$: $237.0481673\ \rm u$

and the speed of light squared is $931.494 \rm MeV/u$.

Using the mass-energy equivalence and the difference of left-hand side and right-hand side:

$$
\begin{array}{l}
	E &=& (241.0568229 \rm u - 237.0481673 u - 4.00260325u) \\
	&& \times 931.494 \rm MeV/u \\
	&=& 5.64 \rm MeV
\end{array}
$$
