Global warming potentials are values for comparing the impact of [[Green House Gas|green house gases]]. (<u>1</u>)

Here lists some [[Green House Gas|green house gases]] and its global warming potential: (<u>2</u>)

| [[Green House Gas\|greenhouse gas]] | Chemical formula | Global warming potential |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------ |
| Carbon-dioxide                      | $\rm CO_2$       | 1                        |
| Methane                             | $\rm CH_4$       | 21                       |
| Nitrous oxide                       | $\rm N_2O$       | 310                      |
| CFC-12                              | $\rm CCl_2F_2$   | 6200~7100                |
