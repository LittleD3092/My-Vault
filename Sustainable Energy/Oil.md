# Location

Oil is located between gas and water, as shown in the figure below:

# Collect

We use pump jack well to gather siphon oil. The following figure shows the mechanism of a pump jack well:

# Refine

Oil needs to be refined in order to be used in various applications.

Because oil contains substances that have different boiling temperature, we can use a fractionating distillation column to extract them.

In the refining process, the ratio of substances produced is **imbalance**. So we need to convert lower demand substances into higher demand substances.

## Cracking

Breaking down the substances into **lighter** ones is called **cracking**.

- [[Steam Cracking]]
- [[Hydro Cracking]]
- [[Catalytic Cracking]]

## Polymerization

**Polymerization** means to stick light hydrocarbons together, and form **heavier** ones.
