Rankine cycle is a thermodynamic cycle describing the process of a heat engine. (<u>1</u>)

Rankine cycle is composed of 4 steps, illustrated in the figure below: (<u>1</u>)

| Indexes | Step                        | Explanation                                                                         |
| ------- | --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 -> 2  | Isentropic compression      | The pump increases the fluid's pressure.                                            |
| 2 -> 3  | Heating                     | The heater (burns fuel) increases the temperature of fluid, converting it to steam. |
| 3 -> 4  | Isentropic expansion        | The turbine spins and reduces the temperature and the pressure of the steam.        |
| 4 -> 1  | Heat rejection in condenser | The steam enters the condenser, and turns to fluid.                                 |
