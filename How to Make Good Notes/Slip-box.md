The slip-box is a box with notes inside. The notes are written on a small piece of paper. This box is a **main idea generator**.

Luhmann has 2 slip-boxes:

- **Bibliographical** one (for references and brief notes).
- **Main** one (The content of what he reads).

Luhmann follows the steps to enrich his slip-box:

1. Read something. Write bibliographic information on one side, and write the brief notes on the other side. This note goes into the **bibliographical box**.
2. Shortly after, think about how to extend the main box using the notes in the bibliographical box. Write a new note in **full sentences**, and with **explicit references**.
3. **Link** to other notes in the main box, and put the new note in.

> Note: Do not simply copy and paste the sentence. Use your own words.
