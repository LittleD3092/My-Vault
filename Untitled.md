On the boundary, 

$$\sigma_B = \sigma_A -350$$

$$\implies \sigma_A - \sigma_B = 350$$

We already know the stress on the load line is

$$(\sigma_A, \sigma_B) = (140n, -40n)$$

Therefore, by substuting the above stress to the boundary, we get

$$140n - (-40n) = 350$$

$$n = \frac{350}{140-(-40)}$$
