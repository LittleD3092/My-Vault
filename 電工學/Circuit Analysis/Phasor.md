For a sinusoidal voltage of the form

$$v_1(t) = V_1\cos(\omega t + \theta_1)$$

we define the phasor as

$${ \bf V }_{ 1 } = 
V_1 \angle \theta_1$$

# Phasor Conversion

If the sinusoid is of the form

$$v_2(t) = V_2\sin(\omega t + \theta_2)$$

> $$\sin(z) = \cos(z - 90\degree)$$

$$\implies v_2(t) = 
V_2 \cos(\omega t + \theta_2 - 90\degree)$$

$$\implies { \bf V }_{ 2 } = V_2 \angle \theta_2 - 90 \degree$$

# Phasor Diagram

The current plot of previous AC steady state result can be plotted in phasor plot to show the validity of KCL and KVL
