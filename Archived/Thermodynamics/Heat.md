原子分子運動互相撞擊或振動來回而產生熱能

用 $Q$ 代表

1. transferred by the virtue of temperature difference
2. a body never contains heat, can be identified only as it crosses the boundary
3. unit: $J$

- [[Adiabatic Process]]: no heat transfer $(Q = 0)$

# 正負

$$
\begin{array}{}
	+Q \text{ : Heat transfer to a system } \\
	-Q \text{ : Heat transfer from a system }
\end{array}
$$

# Rate of Heat Transfer

$$\dot{ Q } = \frac{ \delta Q }{ dt }$$

# [[Specific Heat Transfer]]

$$q = \frac{ Q }{ m }$$
$m$: mass

# Heat Transfer Modes

- [[Conduction]]: transfer of heat between molecules
- [[Convection]]: transfer of heat from a [[Surface]] to a ==flowing== media
- [[Radiation]]: transfer of heat due to electromagnetic waves
