- a process can be reversed without change in systems or surroundings
ex.單擺, Quasi-equilibrium expansion and compresion

- Irreversibility: 有關不可逆性質的係數

# Factors that render processes irreversible

1. Friction
2. Unrestrained expansion
3. Heat transfer through a finite temperature difference
4. Mixing of two different substances

# [[Work]] of Reversible [[Work]]

$$\text{ close system: }\quad Work = Pd\nu$$
$$\text{ open system: }\quad Work = \nu dP$$
