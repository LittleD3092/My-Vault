![[example of shear force and bending moment diagram.png]]

Above is a shear force diagram $V-x$ diagram and a bending moment diagram $M-x$ diagram. The loading graph $(a)$ is integrated and get the shear force diagram $(b)$. Then the diagram $(b)$ is integrated and get the moment diagram $(c)$.

$$V(x) = \int q(x)dx$$
$$M(x) = \int V(x)dx$$
