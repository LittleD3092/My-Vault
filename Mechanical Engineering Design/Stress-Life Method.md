The stress-life method relies on studies of test specimens subjected to controlled cycling between two stress levels, known as **constant amplitude loading**.

- $\sigma_{\rm min}$: minimum stress
- $\sigma_{\rm max}$: maximum stress
- $\sigma_{m}$: mean stress, or midrange stress
- $\sigma_a$: alternating stress, or stress amplitude
- $\sigma_r$: stress range

$$\sigma_a = \left\vert
	\frac{\sigma_{\rm max} - \sigma_{\rm min}}{2}
\right\vert$$

$$\sigma_m = \frac{\sigma_{\rm max} + \sigma_{\rm min}}{2}$$

# S-N Diagram

We can plot the complete reversed alternating stress versus the life in cycles on a semi-log or log-log scale.

This plot is called a *Wohler curve*, a *stress-life diagram*, or an *S-N diagram*.

- $S_e$:Endurance limit, also called fatigue limit. Below this stress, the material will not fatigue.

The S-N diagram can be simplified to an idealized S-N diagram.

## Estimating the Endurance Limit

The endurance limit is often estimated by observing the diagram generated by experiment.

For steels, we use

$$S_e' = 
\left\{
	\begin{array}{l}
		0.5S_{ut} & S_{ut} \leq 200 \text{ kpsi } (1400\text{ MPa}) \\
		100 \text{ kpsi} & S_{ut} > 200\text{ kpsi} \\
		700 \text{ MPa} & S_{ut} > 1400\text{ MPa}
	\end{array}
\right.$$

Note that $S_e'$ is for testing result, we will discuss the true endurance limit $S_e$ in [[#Endurance Limit Modifying Factors]].

## Fatigue Strength for High-Cycle

When the life is between $10^3$ and $10^6$ cycles, we can approximate and calculate $S_f$ using the *Basquin's equation*.

$$S_f = aN^b$$

$$a = \frac{(fS_{ut})^2}{S_e}$$

$$b = -\frac 1 3 \log\left(
	\frac{fS_{ut}}{S_e}
\right)$$

- $N$: Life cycle.

Modifying the equation above, we can get a representation of the life cycle.

$$N = \left(
	\frac{\sigma_{ar}}{a}
\right)^{1/b}$$

- $\sigma_{ar}$: Alternating stress.

Fatigue strength fraction $f$ can be obtained by the diagram below.
