The stress-life method relies on studies of test specimens subjected to controlled cycling between two stress levels, known as **constant amplitude loading**.

- $\sigma_{\rm min}$: minimum stress
- $\sigma_{\rm max}$: maximum stress
- $\sigma_{m}$: mean stress, or midrange stress
- $\sigma_a$: alternating stress, or stress amplitude
- $\sigma_r$: stress range

$$\sigma_a = \left\vert
	\frac{\sigma_{\rm max} - \sigma_{\rm min}}{2}
\right\vert$$

$$\sigma_m = \frac{\sigma_{\rm max} + \sigma_{\rm min}}{2}$$

# S-N Diagram

We can plot the complete reversed alternating stress versus the life in cycles on a semi-log or log-log scale.

This plot is called a *Wohler curve*, a *stress-life diagram*, or an *S-N diagram*.

- $S_e$:Endurance limit, also called fatigue limit. Below this stress, the material will not fatigue.

The S-N diagram can be simplified to an idealized S-N diagram.

## Estimating the Endurance Limit

The endurance limit is often estimated by observing the diagram generated by experiment.

For steels, we use

$$S_e' = 
\left\{
	\begin{array}{l}
		0.5S_{ut} & S_{ut} \leq 200 \text{ kpsi } (1400\text{ MPa}) \\
		100 \text{ kpsi} & S_{ut} > 200\text{ kpsi} \\
		700 \text{ MPa} & S_{ut} > 1400\text{ MPa}
	\end{array}
\right.$$

Note that $S_e'$ is for testing result, we will discuss the true endurance limit $S_e$ in [[#Endurance Limit Modifying Factors]].

## Fatigue Strength for High-Cycle

When the life is between $10^3$ and $10^6$ cycles, we can approximate and calculate $S_f$ using the *Basquin's equation*.

$$S_f = aN^b$$

$$a = \frac{(fS_{ut})^2}{S_e}$$

$$b = -\frac 1 3 \log\left(
	\frac{fS_{ut}}{S_e}
\right)$$

- $N$: Life cycle.

Modifying the equation above, we can get a representation of the life cycle.

$$N = \left(
	\frac{\sigma_{ar}}{a}
\right)^{1/b}$$

- $\sigma_{ar}$: Alternating stress.

Fatigue strength fraction $f$ can be obtained by the diagram below.

# Endurance Limit Modifying Factors

We estimated the endurance limit $S_e'$ by the lab results. But it is unrealistic to expect the endurance limit to match the values obtained in the laboratory.

Some factors that will change the endurance limit $S_e$ includes:

- **Material**: composition, basis of failure, variability
- **Manufacturing**: method, heat treatment, fretting corrosion, surface condition, stress concentration
- **Environment**: corrosion, temperature, stress state, relaxation times
- **Design**: size, shape, life, stress state, speed, fretting, galling

Marin proposed that correction factors for each effect be applied as multipliers to adjust the endurance limit. Marin's equation is written as

$$S_e = k_ak_bk_ck_dk_eS_e'$$

- $k_a$: [[#Surface Factor]]
- $k_b$: [[#Size Factor]]
- $k_c$: [[#Load Factor]]
- $k_d$: [[#Temperature Factor]]
- $k_e$: [[#Reliability Factor]]
- $S_e'$: Rotary-beam test specimen endurance limit.
- $S_e$: Endurance limit at the critical location of a machine part in the geometry and condition of use.

## Surface Factor

Represented by $k_a$.

In laboratory, the specimen is polished. In practical situation, the parts have surface roughness, which cause localized stress concentration. This creates an environment that is prone to crack initiation.

Lipson and Noll collected data from studies and organize them into several common commercial surface finishes. An example is the diagram below.
