The stress-life method relies on studies of test specimens subjected to controlled cycling between two stress levels, known as **constant amplitude loading**.

![[Pasted image 20221116135240.png]]

- $\sigma_{\rm min}$: minimum stress
- $\sigma_{\rm max}$: maximum stress
- $\sigma_{m}$: mean stress, or midrange stress
- $\sigma_a$: alternating stress, or stress amplitude
- $\sigma_r$: stress range

$$\sigma_a = \left\vert
	\frac{\sigma_{\rm max} - \sigma_{\rm min}}{2}
\right\vert$$

$$\sigma_m = \frac{\sigma_{\rm max} + \sigma_{\rm min}}{2}$$

# S-N Diagram

We can plot the complete reversed alternating stress versus the life in cycles on a semi-log or log-log scale.

![[Pasted image 20221116171156.png]]

This plot is called a *Wohler curve*, a *stress-life diagram*, or an *S-N diagram*.

- $S_e$:Endurance limit, also called fatigue limit. Below this stress, the material will not fatigue.

The S-N diagram can be simplified to an idealized S-N diagram.

## Estimating the Endurance Limit

The endurance limit is often estimated by observing the diagram generated by experiment.

For steels, we use

$$S_e' = 
\left\{
	\begin{array}{l}
		0.5S_{ut} & S_{ut} \leq 200 \text{ kpsi } (1400\text{ MPa}) \\
		100 \text{ kpsi} & S_{ut} > 200\text{ kpsi} \\
		700 \text{ MPa} & S_{ut} > 1400\text{ MPa}
	\end{array}
\right.$$

Note that $S_e'$ is for testing result, we will discuss the true endurance limit $S_e$ in [[#Endurance Limit Modifying Factors]].

## Fatigue Strength for High-Cycle

When the life is between $10^3$ and $10^6$ cycles, we can approximate and calculate $S_f$ using the *Basquin's equation*.

$$S_f = aN^b$$

$$a = \frac{(fS_{ut})^2}{S_e}$$

$$b = -\frac 1 3 \log\left(
	\frac{fS_{ut}}{S_e}
\right)$$

- $N$: Life cycle.

Modifying the equation above, we can get a representation of the life cycle.

$$N = \left(
	\frac{\sigma_{ar}}{a}
\right)^{1/b}$$

- $\sigma_{ar}$: Alternating stress.

Fatigue strength fraction $f$ can be obtained by the diagram below.

# Endurance Limit Modifying Factors

We estimated the endurance limit $S_e'$ by the lab results. But it is unrealistic to expect the endurance limit to match the values obtained in the laboratory.

Some factors that will change the endurance limit $S_e$ includes:

- **Material**: composition, basis of failure, variability
- **Manufacturing**: method, heat treatment, fretting corrosion, surface condition, stress concentration
- **Environment**: corrosion, temperature, stress state, relaxation times
- **Design**: size, shape, life, stress state, speed, fretting, galling

Marin proposed that correction factors for each effect be applied as multipliers to adjust the endurance limit. Marin's equation is written as

$$S_e = k_ak_bk_ck_dk_eS_e'$$

- $k_a$: [[#Surface Factor]]
- $k_b$: [[#Size Factor]]
- $k_c$: [[#Load Factor]]
- $k_d$: [[#Temperature Factor]]
- $k_e$: [[#Reliability Factor]]
- $S_e'$: Rotary-beam test specimen endurance limit.
- $S_e$: Endurance limit at the critical location of a machine part in the geometry and condition of use.

## Surface Factor

Represented by $k_a$.

In laboratory, the specimen is polished. In practical situation, the parts have surface roughness, which cause localized stress concentration. This creates an environment that is prone to crack initiation.

> It is significant to note that this is not entirely a factor of the surface roughness, but also includes metallurgical conditions.

Lipson and Noll collected data from studies and organize them into several common commercial surface finishes. An example is the diagram below.

![[Pasted image 20221117153316.png]]

For convenience, the curves of figure above are fitted with a power curve equation

$$k_a = aS_{ut}^b$$

Where $a$ and $b$ are given in the table below.

| Surface Finish         | Factor $a$, with $S_{ut}$ in $\text{kpsi}$ | Factor $a$, with $S_{ut}$ in $\text{MPa}$ | Exponent $b$ |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| Ground                 | $1.21$                                     | $1.38$                                    | $-0.067$     |
| Machined or cold-drawn | $2.00$                                     | $3.04$                                    | $-0.217$     |
| Hot-rolled             | $11.0$                                     | $38.6$                                    | $-0.650$     |
| As-forged              | $12.7$                                     | $54.9$                                    | $-0.758$     | 

## Size Factor

Represented by $k_b$.

The endurance limit of specimens loaded in bending and torsion has been observed to decrease slightly as the specimen size increases.

### Round Rotating Bars

The factor can be evaluated using a compilation of data from several sources. The curve-fit equations for round rotating bars in bending and torsion can be given by

$$
k_b = 
\left\{
	\begin{array}{l}
		\displaystyle\left(\frac{d}{0.3}\right)^{-0.107}=0.879d^{-0.107} &
		0.3 \leq d \leq 2 \text{ in} \\
		0.91d^{-0.157} &
		2 < d \leq 10 \text{ in} \\
		\displaystyle\left(\frac{d}{7.62}\right)^{-0.107} = 1.24d^{-0.107} & 7.62 \leq d \leq 51 \text{ mm} \\
		1.51d^{-0.157} & 51 < d \leq 254 \text{ mm}
	\end{array}
\right.
$$

> For $d$ less than $3\text{ in}$, the data is scattered. Unless more specific data is available to warrant a higher value, $k_b = 1$ is recommended.

For axial loading there is no size effect, so

$$k_b = 1$$

### Other Shapes and Non Rotating

The section [[#Round Rotating Bars]] is for rotating and round bars only. For non-rotating and other shapes, the load is applied at the same area again and again, therefore the endurance limit is smaller than round rotating bars.

Thus, we substitude $d$ of the equation in [[#Round Rotating Bars]] to equivalent diameter $d_e$ based on different shapes.

> Kuguel introduced a critical volume theory in which the volume of material experiencing a stress above $95\%$ of the maximum stress is considered to be critical.
> 
> Let's illustrate it by calculating $d_e$ for nonrotating bar:
> 
> The method employs an *equivalent diameter* $d_e$ obtained by equating **the volume of material** stressed at and above $95\%$ of the maximum stress
> $$A_{0.95\sigma} = 0.01046d^2 \qquad \text{for non-rotating bar}$$
> to the same volume in the **rotating-beam specimen**.
> $$A_{0.95\sigma} = \frac \pi 4 [d^2 - (0.95d)^2] = 0.0766d^2 \qquad \text{for rotating bar}$$
> $$\implies 0.01046d^2 = 0.0766d_e^2$$
> $$\implies d_e = 0.370d \qquad \text{for non-rotating bar}$$

The below chart shows common nonrotating structural shapes and its corresponding $A_{0.95\sigma}$.

## Load Factor

Represented by $k_c$.

Estimates of endurance limit in [[#Other Shapes and Non Rotating]] are obtained from completely reversed bending.

For other loading types, a load factor is used.

$$k_c = 
\left\{
	\begin{array}{l}
		1 & \text{bending} \\
		0.85 & \text{axial} \\
		0.59 & \text{torsion}
	\end{array}
\right.$$
