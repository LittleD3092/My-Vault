The stress-life method relies on studies of test specimens subjected to controlled cycling between two stress levels, known as **constant amplitude loading**.

- $\sigma_{\rm min}$: minimum stress
- $\sigma_{\rm max}$: maximum stress
- $\sigma_{m}$: mean stress, or midrange stress
- $\sigma_a$: alternating stress, or stress amplitude
- $\sigma_r$: stress range

$$\sigma_a = \left\vert
	\frac{\sigma_{\rm max} - \sigma_{\rm min}}{2}
\right\vert$$

$$\sigma_m = \frac{\sigma_{\rm max} + \sigma_{\rm min}}{2}$$
