# Phases

There are six phases of design process as follows.

```

Note that the graph above does not include side arrows for simplicity. Designing can go wrong, and their is always going back to previous steps.

## 1. Identification of Need

This is the start of design. This is a highly creative process, because the need often comes from a feeling of "something is not right".

## 2. Definition of Problem

The problem is written by a definition about what the "black box" can do. The input, output, characteristics, and specification are included in the definition.

## 3. Synthesis

Often called the invention of the concept or concept design. Various schemes must be proposed, investigated, and quantified in terms of established metrics.

## 4. Analysis and Optimization

The system performance is analyzed and compared, and the worse one is discarded. If a design does not pass on this step, we will go back to [[#3 Synthesis]].

There is a high chance that a design will not pass this step.

## 5. Evaluation

This step often includes testing the prototype in a lab. This is the final proof of the whole process, the system should be able to fulfill its mission defined in [[#2 Definition of Problem]].

There will be engineering problems (such as is it easily maintained and adjusted?) and non-engineering problems (such as is it profitable?). The design should be able to overcome all these problems.

## 6. Presentation

In this step, the designer will communicate to superiors. The designer should prove to them that this solution is a better one than others. One may succeed and get higher pay after this step. However, if a design does not pass this step, all the efforts in step 1 ~ 5 will be in vain.
