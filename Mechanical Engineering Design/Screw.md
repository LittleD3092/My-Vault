# Terminology

The terminology of screws is explaned as follows:

- **Pitch**: The distance between adjacent thread forms measured parallel to the thread axis.
	- The pitch in U.S. units is the reciprocal of the number of thread forms per inch $N$.
- **Major diameter** $d$: The largest diameter of a screw thread.
- **Minor diameter (root diameter)** $d_r$: The smallest diameter of a screw thread.
- **Pitch diameter** $d_p$: Theoretical diameter between the major and minor diameters.
- **Lead** $l$: The distance the nut moves parallel to the screw axis when the nut is given one turn.
	- For a single thread, the lead is the same as the pitch.

- *Multiple-threaded*: Having two or more threads cut beside each other, like two or more strings wound side by side around a pencil.
	- *Single threads*: Standardized screws, bolts and nuts.
	- *Double-threaded*: Has a lead equal to twice the pitch.
	- *Triple-threaded*: Has a lead equal to 3 times the pitch.
