Also known as strain hardened. This process creates a longer linear elastic curve, and therefore prevent fatigue failures. The process contains following steps.

# Steps

1. The ambient temperature is below the recrystalization temperature of the material.
2. Loading to point $i$ beyond yield point, then unloading, causing permanent deformation.
3. The curve has been modified that there is a longer linear curve, like the dash line part of the following graph.

Now reloading to $i$ bahaves elastically all the way up to $i$.

# Cons

The area of the material decreases, also make the ductile material more brittle.
