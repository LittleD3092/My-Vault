Fatigue falure is due to crack nucleation and propagation.

- This is often at a discontinuity in the material, like
	- Geometric changes in cross section.
	- Manufacturing imperfections:
		- Stamp marks.
		- Tool marks.
		- Scratches.
	- Composition of the material itself.

# Stages of Fatigue Failure

A fatigue failure is characterized by three stages.

1. ==Stage I==
	- The initiation of one or more microcracks due to cyclic plastic deformation followed by crystallographic propagation extending from three to ten grains from the origin.
	- The cracks are not normally discernible to the naked eye.
2. ==Stage 2==
	- Progresses from microcracks to macrocracks forming parallel plateau-like fracture surfaces separated by longitudinal ridges.
	- The plateaus are generally smooth and normal to the direction of maximum tensile stress.
	- The surfaces are characterized by dark and light bands referred to as beach marks.
3. ==Stage 3==
	- Occurs during the final stress cycle when the material of the remaining cross section cannot support the loads, resulting in a sudden, fast fracture.
	- A stage III fracture can be brittle, ductile, or a combination of both.
