- Fatigue failure is not a consequence of changed material properties. Actually, fatigue failure is from a crack initiating and growing when subjected to many repeated cycles of stress.

There are a lot of concepts involving fatigue failure:

- [[Crack Nucleation and Propagation]]
- [[Fatigue-Life Methods]]
- [[Linear-Elastic Fracture Mechanics Method]]
- [[Strain-Life Method]]
- [[Stress-Life Method]]
- [[Surface Fatigue]]
