There is no universal theory of failure for the general case of material properties and stress state. Instead, over the years several hypotheses have been formulated and tested, leading to today's accepted practices.

The generally accepted theories are:

- Ductile materials (yield criteria)
	- [[Maximum Shear Stress]]
	- [[Distortion Energy]]
	- [[Ductile Coulomb-Mohr]]
- Brittle materials (fracture criteria)
	- [[Maximum Normal Stress]]
	- [[Brittle Coulob-Mohr]]
	- [[Modified Mohr]]
