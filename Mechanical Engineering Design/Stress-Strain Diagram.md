There are two types of material, ductile and brittle. The stress-strain diagrams of these two materials differ in some ways.

# Ductile

![[ductile example diagram - stress-strain diagram.png|300]]

There are some important points on the curve of the diagram above:

- $pl$: Before this point, the curve is linear and obey [[Hooke's Law]].
$$\sigma = E\varepsilon$$
- $el$: From $pl$ to $el$, the curve is no longer linear, but no permanent deformation is formed. After this point, there will be plastic deformation, which means that if release stress, the sample will not go back to the original length.
- $y$: This point is the yield point.
	- If the stress is released on this point, the strain will be $0.2\%$.
	- The stress on this point is called yield stress.
- $u$: This point is the ultimate point.
	- The stress here can be represented as $S_u$ and $S_{ut}$, meaning "ultimate" and "ultimate tension".
- $f$: This point is the fracture point.
	- The sample will break into two halfs on this point.

# Brittle

For brittle diagrams, the ultimate point and fracture point is on the same position.

# True Stress-Strain Diagram

The graphs that we see above is called engineering stress-strain diagrams. There are two kinds of stress and strain:

- Engineering stress: The stress is based on the original area.
- True stress: The stress is based on the actual area.

It is usually hard to measure the actual area, because the area changes through the testing. Therefore we often use engineering stress.

However, it is good to know what a true stress-strain diagram looks like. It turns out that both [[#Ductile]] and [[#Brittle]] diagram looks like this:
