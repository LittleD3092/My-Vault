The material response will have a stable cyclic hysteresis loop, as in figure above. The total true strain $\Delta \tilde \varepsilon / 2$ is resolved into elastic and plastic components, $\displaystyle \Delta \tilde \varepsilon_e / 2$ and $\displaystyle\Delta \tilde \varepsilon_p / 2$.

If we plot the two strain components and total strain with reversals on a graph, we get three lines:

The equations of the plastic strain line and the elastic strain line are well known and named, and are given below.

$$
\begin{array}{l}
	\text{Plastic-strain Manson-Coffin equation} & 
	\displaystyle \frac{\Delta \tilde \varepsilon_p}{2} = 
	\varepsilon_f'(2N)^c \\
	\text{Elastic-strain Basquin equation} & 
	\displaystyle\frac{\Delta\tilde\varepsilon_e}{2} = \frac{\sigma'_f}{E}(2N)^b
\end{array}
$$

- ==Fatigue ductility coefficient== $\varepsilon_f'$ is the ordinate intercept (at 1 reversal, $2N = 1$) of the plastic-strain line. It is approximately equal to the true fracture strain.
- ==Fatigue==
