# Null Hypothesis

The null hypothesis of Z-test is: (<u>1</u>)

$$
H_0: \mu = \mu_0
$$

# Test Statistic

The test statistic of Z-test is: (<u>1</u>)

$$
Z_0 = \frac{\bar X - \mu_0}{\displaystyle \frac \sigma {\sqrt{n}}}
$$

- $\bar X$: The mean from the experiment.
- $\mu_0$: The mean from the null hypothesis.
- $\sigma$: The population standard deviation.
- $n$: The sample size of the experiment.

# Rejection Criterion

We can decide whether to reject the null hypothesis from the following table: (<u>1</u>)

| Alternative Hypotheses  | Rejection Criterion                                        |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| $$H_1: \mu \neq \mu_0$$ | $$z_0 > z_{\alpha / 2} \text{ or } z_0 < -z_{\alpha / 2}$$ |
| $$H_1: \mu > \mu_0$$    | $$z_0 > z_{\alpha}$$                                       |
| $$H_1: \mu < \mu_0$$    | $$z_0 < -z_{\alpha}$$                                      |
