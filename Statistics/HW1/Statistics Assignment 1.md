## 1. Accounting and Machiavellianism

### a. Population of interest

The population of interest is the alumni of a large southwestern university.

### b. Quantitative or qualitative

| Quantitative                                                              | Qualitative                      |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| <li>Age<li>Income<li>Job satisfaction score<li>Machiavellian rating score | <li>Gender<li>Level of education |

### c. The sample

The sample consists of the 198 questionnaires.

### d. Inference made by the researcher

The researcher suggests that Machiavellian behavior is not required to achieve success in the accounting profession.

## 2. MLB statistics

### a. The third quartile

The third quartile is the value between the 5th and 6th player:

$$\frac{41 + 40}{2} = \underline{40.5}_\#$$

### b. The median

The median is the value between the 10th and 11st player:

$$\frac{37 + 36}{2} = \underline{36.5}_\#$$

### c. The interquartile range

The interquartile range $\text{IQR}$ is the difference between the third quartile $Q_3$ and the first quartile $Q_1$:

$$\text{IQR} = Q_3 - Q_1$$

The first quartile $Q_1$ is the value between the 15th and 16th player, and the third quartile $Q_3$ is already calculated in one of the previous questions:

$$
\left\{
\begin{array}{l}
	Q_1 = \displaystyle
	\frac{33 + 33}{2} = 33 \\
	Q_3 = 40.5
\end{array}
\right.$$

Using the values $Q_1$ and $Q_3$, we can get the interquartile range $\rm IQR$:

$$
\begin{array}{l}
	\rm IQR &=& Q_3 - Q_1 \\
	&=& 40.5 - 33 \\
	&=& \underline{7.5}_\#
\end{array}
$$

### d. The mode

The mode is $\underline{33}_\#$ since it appears 4 times (the most times) in the data set.

### e. Outliers

The outliers are observations that fall below $Q_1 - 1.5\rm IQR$ or above $Q_3 + 1.5 \rm IQR$:

$$
\left\{
	\begin{array}{l}
		Q_1 - 1.5\rm IQR &=& 33 - 1.5 \cdot 7.5 &=& 21.75 \\
		Q_3 + 1.5\rm IQR &=& 40.5 + 1.5 \cdot 7.5 &=& 51.75
	\end{array}
\right.
$$
Looking at the chart, there is one player above $Q_3 + 1.5 \rm IQR$ and there is no player below $Q_1 - 1.5 \rm IQR$. Therefore there is only $\underline{1}_\#$ outlier in this data set.
