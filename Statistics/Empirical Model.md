An empirical model is built from our knowledge of the phenomenon, but is **not directly developed** using the theoretical methods. (<u>1</u>)

For example, we can guess that an average molecular weight is related to several factors: (<u>1</u>)

$$M_n = f(V, C, T) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 V + \beta_2 C + \beta_3 T + \epsilon$$

- $V$: [[Viscosity]].
- $C$: The amount of catalyst.
- $T$: Temperature.
