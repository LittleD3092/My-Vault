The population variance calculates the variance for the whole population, different from [[Sample Variance|sample variance]], which computes an estimate of population variance. (<u>1</u>)

$$\sigma^2 = \frac{
	\displaystyle
	\sum_{i = 1}^N (x_i - \mu)^2
}{N}$$

- $\mu$: [[Population Mean|Population mean]].

> [[Sample Variance|Sample variance]] is a reasonable estimation of population variance. (<u>1</u>)
