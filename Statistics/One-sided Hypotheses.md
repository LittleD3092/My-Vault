One-sided hypotheses, different to [[Two-sided Hypotheses]], have only one side for the "not equal" hypotheses. (<u>1</u>)

For example, whether or not the mean burning rate is $50 \text{ m/s}$ will be written as: (<u>1</u>)

$$
\begin{array}{}
	H_0: & \mu &=& 50\text{ cm/s} \\
	H_1: & \mu &<& 50 \text{ cm/s} \\
	&& \text{or} \\
	H_0: & \mu &=& 50\text{ cm/s} \\
	H_1: & \mu &>& 50 \text{ cm/s} \\
\end{array}
$$
