The variance $V(X)$ of a random variable $X$ can be calculated by: (<u>1</u>)

$$\sigma^2 = V(X) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty (x - \mu)^2 f(x)dx = E(X^2) - \mu^2$$

- $\sigma$: The [[Standard Deviation of Continuous Random Variables|standard deviation]].
- $\mu$: The [[Mean of Continuous Random Variables|mean]].
- $f(x)$: The [[Probability Density Function|PDF]].
- $E(X^2)$: Expected value of $X^2$.
