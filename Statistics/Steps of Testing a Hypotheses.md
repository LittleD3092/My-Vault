To illustrate the steps of testing a hypotheses, we will start from an example problem: (<u>1</u>)

> Test that the average of the population in a home is $3$.

1. State the question statistically.
	- $\mu = 3$, the average of the population is $3$.
2. State the opposite statistically.
	- $\mu \neq 3$, the average of the population is not $3$.
3. Select the alternative hypothesis $H_a$, from the statement that has unequal.
	- $H_a$: $\mu \neq 3$.
4. State the null hypothesis $H_0$.
	- $H_0$: $\mu = 3$.
