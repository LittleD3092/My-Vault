- In practice, operating systems combine different structure, resulting in hybrid systems.
- Example:
	- Linux and Solaris are monolithic, because it provides very efficient performance.
	- They are also modular, so that new functionality can be added.
- Another example:
	- Windows is monolithic, for performance reasons.
	- It has some behavior of microkernels, providing support for separate subsystems.
