# Characteristics

## The Entrance Region

- When a laminar flow with uniform velocity $U_0$ enters a pipe, because of the no-slip condition, the velocity at the wall must be zero.
- The speed of the fluid in the neighborhood of the surface is reduced.
- At a distance along the pipe in the entry region, the effect of the solid surface is felt farther out into the flow.

- When the profile shape no longer changes with increasing distance $x$, the flow is **fully developed**.
- The distance between the entrance and the fully developed place is **entrance length**.
	- For laminar flow, the entrance length is $$\frac L D \simeq 0.06\frac{\rho \bar V D}{\mu}$$where $$\bar V = \frac Q A$$
