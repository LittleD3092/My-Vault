We use loop invariants to help us understand why an algorithm is correct. We must show three things about a loop invariant:

- Initialization: It is true prior to the first iteration of the loop.
- Maintenance: If it is true before an iteration of the loop, it remains true before the next iteration.
- Termination: When the loop terminates, the invariant gives us a useful property that helps show that the algorithm is correct.
