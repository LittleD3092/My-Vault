The resistance of a material to penetration is called hardness. There are many hardness-measuring systems, but we consider only the two of them:

1. [[#Rockwell Hardness]]
2. [[#Brinell Hardness]]

Hardness can be used to measure the [[Strength]] property of a material. Like for steel, the [[Strength]] is given by:

$$S_u = \left\{
	\begin{array}{}
		0.5H_B & \text{kpsi} \\
		3.4H_B & \text{MPa}
	\end{array}
\right.$$

# Rockwell Hardness

Rockwell hardness is obtained from the test machine, read directly from a dial. The indenters on the machines are described as a diamond, a ball.

# Brinell Hardness

The hardness number of Brinell hardness $H_B$ is found as a number equal to the applied load divided by the spherical surface area of the indentation. Therefore, the units of $H_B$ is the same as [[Stress]].

Brinell hardness takes more testing time than [[#Rockwell Hardness]], because $H_B$ must be computed from the test data.
