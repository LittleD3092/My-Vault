A tree structure means that the data are organized in a hierarchical manner. It is a finite set of one or more nodes such that

1. There is a specially designated node called the "root".
2. The remaining nodes are partitioned into $n \geq 0$ disjoint sets $T_1, \dots, T_n$, where each of these sets is a tree. $T_1, \dots, T_n$ are called the "subtrees" of the root

There are two types of genealogical charts that are used to present such data:

- [[#Pedigree Chart]]
- [[#Lineal Chart]]

# Pedigree Chart

- normally two-way branching
- not allow for inbreeding
- show ancestors

An example of pedigree chart, shows the ancesters relationship:

In this case, Brandy and Honey Bear are Dusty's parents.

# Lineal Chart

- show decendents
- each item can produce several others

An example of lineal chart, it shows the descendents of European language:

# Terms

## Degree

The number of subtrees of a node is called its "degree". For example, in the example in [[#Lineal Chart]], "Proto Indo-European" has a degree of 3.

## Leaf

Nodes that have [[#Degree]] 0 are called "leaf" or "terminal" nodes.

## Nonterminal

Nodes that are not [[#leaf]] are called "nonterminals".

## Children

The roots of the subtrees of a node $X$ are called "the children of $X$".

For example, the nodes $B, C, D$ are the children of the node $A$:

## Parent

Node $X$ is the "parent" of its children.

For example, the node $A$ is the parent of the children $B, C, D$.
