The probability distribution function way is simple. We organize several data points as a **bin**. Then we plot the bins on a **logarithmic scale plot**, like the figure below (<u>1</u>).

This method has a disadvantage, that on the tail (right section of the graph), each bin is **not significant**. We can solve this by **grouping more data points** into a bin (<u>1</u>):

Or we can use [[Cumulative Distribution Function|cumulative distribution function]] (<u>1</u>), which solves the tail problem.
