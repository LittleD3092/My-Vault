This metaphor suggests that coding is like forming a pearl.

- You start with a grain of sand. It does not need to accept real world inputs and create real world outputs, but it needs to be a skeleton that can be extended to be a fully functional code.
- Then you add small amounts of calcium carbonate. The dummy classes and functions are transformed into real classes and functions, one by one.

This metaphor explains the **incremental development**.
