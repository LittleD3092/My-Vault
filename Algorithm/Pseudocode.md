# Conventions

- Use indentation to show block structure like `for`, `while` and `if`.
- We use keywords `to` when a `for` loop increments its loop counter in each iteration, and we use keyword `downto` when a `for` loop decrements its loop counter. When the for loop counter changes by an amount greater than `1`, the amount of change follows the optional keyword `by`.
```
for i = 1 to 5 by 2
    print i
```
The code above will print `1 3 5`.
- When object or array are passed, the pointers are passed.
- `return` statement allow multiple return values.
- The keyword `error` indicates that an error occurred. The pseudocode does not need to handle error.
