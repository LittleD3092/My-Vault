Shannon entropy is the measure of uncertainty using a random variable $X$. It has the following formula: (<u>1</u>)

$$H(X) = \sum_i P(x_i)\log_b P(x_i)$$

- The formula above is for finite samples.
- $H(X)$: The Shannon entropy of random variable $X$.
- $P(x_i)$: The probability of $X = x_i$.
- $b$: Can be $2, 10$ or $e$, depending on the resulting unit of entropy. For $2$, the unit is bits.
