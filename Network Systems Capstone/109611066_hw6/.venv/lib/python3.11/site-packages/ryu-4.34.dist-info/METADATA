What's Ryu
==========
Ryu is a component-based software defined networking framework.

Ryu provides software components with well defined API's that make it
easy for developers to create new network management and control
applications. Ryu supports various protocols for managing network
devices, such as OpenFlow, Netconf, OF-config, etc. About OpenFlow,
Ryu supports fully 1.0, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5 and Nicira Extensions.

All of the code is freely available under the Apache 2.0 license. Ryu
is fully written in Python.


Quick Start
===========
Installing Ryu is quite easy::

   % pip install ryu

If you prefer to install Ryu from the source code::

   % git clone git://github.com/osrg/ryu.git
   % cd ryu; pip install .

If you want to write your Ryu application, have a look at
`Writing ryu application <http://ryu.readthedocs.io/en/latest/writing_ryu_app.html>`_ document.
After writing your application, just type::

   % ryu-manager yourapp.py


Optional Requirements
=====================

Some functions of ryu require extra packages:

- OF-Config requires lxml and ncclient
- NETCONF requires paramiko
- BGP speaker (SSH console) requires paramiko
- Zebra protocol service (database) requires SQLAlchemy

If you want to use these functions, please install the requirements::

    % pip install -r tools/optional-requires

Please refer to tools/optional-requires for details.


Prerequisites
