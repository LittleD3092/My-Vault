### 2.1. Custom Packet Classes

I defined some data structures to store fields in the packet:

```python
# custom packet class
ETHERTYPE_ARP = 0x0806
ETHERTYPE_IP = 0x0800
class EthernetFrame:
    def __init__(self, src_mac, dst_mac, ethertype, payload):
        self.src_mac = src_mac
        self.dst_mac = dst_mac
        self.ethertype = ethertype
        self.payload = payload

ARP_HARDWARE_TYPE_ETHERNET = 1
ARP_PROTOCOL_TYPE_IP = 0x0800
ARP_OPCODE_REQUEST = 1
ARP_OPCODE_REPLY = 2
class ARPPacket:
    def __init__(self, hardware_type, protocol_type, opcode, sender_mac, sender_ip, target_mac, target_ip):
        self.hardware_type = hardware_type
        self.protocol_type = protocol_type
        self.opcode = opcode
        self.sender_mac = sender_mac
        self.sender_ip = sender_ip
        self.target_mac = target_mac
        self.target_ip = target_ip

IP_PROTOCOL_ICMP = 1
class IPPacket:
    def __init__(self, src_ip, dst_ip, protocol, payload):
        self.src_ip = src_ip
        self.dst_ip = dst_ip
        self.protocol = protocol
        self.payload = payload

ICMP_TYPE_ECHO_REQUEST = 8
ICMP_TYPE_ECHO_REPLY = 0
class ICMPPacket:
    def __init__(self, type, payload):
        self.type = type
        self.payload = payload
```

### 2.2. Host Class

For the host class, I included the packet parsing in function `handle_packet` using nested if-else statements.

```python
def handle_packet(self, packet, income_name):
        # handle incoming packets
        # Preconditions: packet is an object of class 
        #                EthernetFrame.
        # Postconditions: packet is processed and appropriate
        #                 action is taken.
        if packet.ethertype == ETHERTYPE_ARP:
            arp_packet = packet.payload
            if arp_packet.opcode == ARP_OPCODE_REQUEST:
                if arp_packet.target_ip == self.ip:
                    # send ARP reply
            elif arp_packet.opcode == ARP_OPCODE_REPLY:
                # update ARP table
        elif packet.ethertype == ETHERTYPE_IP:
            ip_packet = packet.payload
            if ip_packet.dst_ip == self.ip:
                if ip_packet.protocol == IP_PROTOCOL_ICMP:
                    icmp_packet = ip_packet.payload
                    if icmp_packet.type == ICMP_TYPE_ECHO_REQUEST:
                        # send ICMP echo reply
```

The function `handle_packet` will call the function `send` for replying icmp echo request and arp request.

For function `ping`, I used `if` statement to check if destination ip is in the `arp_table`. If it is, then send the icmp echo request. Otherwise, send arp request first.

```python
def ping(self, dst_ip):
    if self.arp_table.get(dst_ip) is not None:
        # send ICMP echo request
    elif self.ip == dst_ip:
        # handle ping to self
        self.update_arp([self.ip, self.mac])
    else: 
        # send an ARP request
        if self.arp_table.get(dst_ip) is not None:
            # if the destination ip is found,
            # send ICMP echo request
            self.ping(dst_ip)
```

The `send` function is simple, it just calls the next node's `handle_packet` function.

```python
def send(self, packet):
    node = self.port_to # get node connected to this host
    node.handle_packet(packet, self.name) # send packet to the connected node
```

### 2.3. Switch Class

For the switch class, similar `send` and `handle_packet` functions are implemented. The only difference is that in function `handle_packet`, the switch will find the input port using the `income_name`. Then it will flood the packet if the destination mac is not in the `mac_table`.

```python
def send(self, idx, packet): # send to the specified port
    node = self.port_to[idx] 
    node.handle_packet(packet, self.name) 
def handle_packet(self, packet, income_name):
    # handle incoming packets
    # Preconditions: packet is an object of class
    #                EthernetFrame.
    # Postconditions: packet is processed and appropriate
    #                 action is taken.

    # determine the incoming port number from 
    # the name of the incoming node
    income_port = None
    for i in range(self.port_n):
        if self.port_to[i].name == income_name:
            income_port = i
            break

    # update MAC table
    self.update_mac([packet.src_mac, income_port])

    # forward the packet or flood
    if packet.dst_mac in self.mac_table:
        self.send(self.mac_table[packet.dst_mac], packet)
    else:
        for i in range(self.port_n):
            if i != income_port:
                self.send(i, packet)
```

### 2.4. run_net in Main Function

In the main function, I used a `try` statement to handle the `EOFError` exception for testing purposes:

```python
try:
    command_line = input(">> ")
except EOFError:
    return 0
```

I also added a `"show_all"` command to display the ARP table and MAC table of each node.

```python
if command_line.strip() == 'show_all':
    show_table('all_hosts')
    show_table('all_switches')
```

## 3. Questions

### 3.1. What is the difference between broadcasting and flooding in a network?

Broadcasting is a method of sending a message to all nodes in a network. Flooding on the other hand, is also a method of sending a message to all nodes in a network, but it is used when the destination of the message is unknown, and the message will be received by only the intended recipient.

### 3.2. Explain the steps involved in the process of h1 ping h7 when there are no entries in the switch’s MAC table and the host’s ARP table.

1. `h1` does not have the MAC address of `h7` in its ARP table, so it sends an ARP request to find the MAC address of `h7`.
2. The ARP request is received by the switch, which does not have the MAC address of `h1` in its MAC table. Therefore, the switch associates the MAC address of `h1` with the port `0`. The switch does not have the MAC address of `h7` in its MAC table, so it floods the ARP request to all ports except the port `0`.
3. The ARP request is received by `s2` and `h2`. `h2` ignores the ARP request because the destination IP address does not match its own IP address. `s2` does not have the MAC address of `h1` in its MAC table, so it associates the MAC address of `h1` with the port `0`. The switch does not have the MAC address of `h7` in its MAC table, so it floods the ARP request to all ports except the port `0`.
4. Switches `s3` and `s7` receive the ARP request. Same as the previous steps, `s3` knows `h1` is on port `2` and `s7` knows `h1` is on port `0`. The ARP requests flooded by `s3` are ignored by `h3` and `s4`. The ARP requests flooded by `s7` are sent to `s5`.
5. `s5` receives the ARP request and knows that `h1` is on port `2`. The ARP request is flooded to `s4` and `s6`.
6. `s4` receives the ARP request and knows that `h1` is on port `1`. The ARP requests are flooded to `h5` and `h6`, which are ignored. `s6` knows that `h1` is on port `2`, and the ARP request is flooded to `h7` and `h8`.
7. `h8` ignores the ARP request. `h7` on the other hand, receives the ARP request and sends an ARP reply to `h1`.
8. The switches already know the port for `h1`, so the ARP reply is sent to `h1` in the path `h7 -> s6 -> s5 -> s7 -> s2 -> s1 -> h1`. The switches in the path update their MAC tables accordingly.
9. `h1` now has the MAC address of `h7` in its ARP table, and it sends an ICMP echo request to `h7`.
10. The ICMP echo request is sent to `h7` in the path `h1 -> s1 -> s2 -> s7 -> s5 -> s6 -> h7`.
11. `h7` receives the ICMP echo request and sends an ICMP echo reply to `h1`. The reply is sent to `h1` in the path `h7 -> s6 -> s5 -> s7 -> s2 -> s1 -> h1`.

### 3.3. What problem can arise when connecting s2 and s5 together and thus creating a switching loop? How can this issue be addressed? (You should mention the specific algorithm or protocol used.)

When connecting `s2` and `s5` together, a switching loop is created. This can cause broadcast storms, where packets are endlessly forwarded between the switches.

The issue can be addressed using the Spanning Tree Protocol. It elects a root bridge and disables the links that are not part of the spanning tree. This prevents switching loops and broadcast storms.
