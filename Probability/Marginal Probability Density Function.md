Let $X$ and $Y$ be two continuous random variables, and $f_{XY}(x, y)$ is the joint PDF of $X$ and $Y$. The marginal PDF of $X$ and $Y$ are

$$
\begin{array}{rl}
	f_X(x) &=& \displaystyle \int_{-\infty}^\infty f_{XY}(x, y)dy \\
	f_Y(y) &=& \displaystyle \int_{-\infty}^\infty f_{XY} (x, y) dx
\end{array}
$$
