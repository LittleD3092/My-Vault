To prove the continuity, we need to prove that every convergent sequence $\{x_n\}_{n = 1}^\infty$ we have:

$$
\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} f(x_n) = f(\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} x_n)
$$

For probability function, there are two convergent sequence, listed below. In the notes listed below, there are proofs that prove each of them is continuous.

- [[Decreasing Sequence of Events]]
