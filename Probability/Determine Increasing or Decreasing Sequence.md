# Examples

## 1. Intersect of Union

$$
\bigcap_{k = 1}^\infty \bigcup_{n = k}^\infty A_n
$$

---

We define:

$$
B_k = \bigcup_{n = k}^\infty A_n
$$

Therefore it can be written as:

$$
\bigcap_{k = 1}^\infty B_k
$$

Which is a decreasing sequence.

## 2. Union of Intersect

$$
\bigcup_{k = 1}^\infty \bigcap_{n = k}^\infty A_n
$$

---

We define:

$$
B_k = \bigcap_{n = k}^\infty A_n
$$

Therefore it can be written as:

$$
\bigcup_{k = 1}^\infty B_k
$$

Which is an increasing sequence.
