Expected value is the mean of a random variable. (<u>1</u>)

Let $X$ be a discrete random variable with

- the set of possible values $S$
- PMF of $X$ is $p_X(x)$

The expected value of $X$ is defined as (<u>1</u>)

$$
E[X] := \sum_{x \in S} x \cdot p_X(x)
$$

In the other case, if $X$ is a continuous random variable, the expected value of $X$ will be: (<u>2</u>)

$$
E[X] := \int_{-\infty}^\infty x\cdot p_X(x)dx
$$
