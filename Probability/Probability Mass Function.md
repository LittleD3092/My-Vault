For a discrete random variable $X$, the probability mass function is defined as: (<u>1</u>)

$$p(x_i) = P(X = x_i)$$

# Jump Size of CDF

Note that PMF is the jump size of [[Cumulative Distribution Function of Discrete Random Variables]]. (<u>2</u>)

# Properties

For any discrete random variable $X$ with possible values $\{x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots\}$: (<u>2</u>)

1. $p(x_i) = P(X = x_i)$.
2. $p(x) = 0 \text{, if } x \notin \{x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots\}$.
3. $\displaystyle \sum_{i = 1}^\infty p(x_i) = 1$
