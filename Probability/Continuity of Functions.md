Intuitively, a continuous function is considered to be a function that for any point, its left limit is equal to the right limit. However, this rule cannot be applied to functions with no left or right limit, like [[Probability Function]].

Therefore we define that:

> A function $f:\mathbb R \rightarrow \mathbb R$ is **continuous** on $\mathbb R$ if and only if for **every convergent sequence** $\{x_n\}_{n = 1}^\infty$ with limit $\displaystyle \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} = x$, we have: 
> $$\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} f(x_n) = f(x)$$
