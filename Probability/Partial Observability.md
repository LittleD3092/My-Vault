Partial observability is one of the reason of [[Randomness]]. Because we don't know or understand the procedure and the model generating the outcome, the outcome is random.

# Example

Suppose we have a pseudo-random number by [[Middle-Square Method]]. Because we can only observe the outcomes but don't know the hidden part (the procedure and the model), the numbers generated seem to be random.
