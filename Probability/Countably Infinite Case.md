[[Sample Space]] $\Omega$ is said to be countably infinite if there exists a 1-to-1 correspondence between $\Omega$ and the set of all positive integers $\mathbb N$.

# Example

$\Omega$ is the set of tuples of positive integers. Is $\{(p, q): p, q \in \mathbb N\}$ countably infinite?

---

If we construct a table of the set of tuples, we can use diagonal lines to count each pair.
