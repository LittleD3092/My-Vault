r""" A policy that acts as a wrapper on another policy `P`, which requires to know the range :math:`[a, b]` of the rewards, by implementing a "doubling trick" to adapt to an unknown range of rewards.

It's an interesting variant of the "doubling trick", used to tackle another unknown aspect of sequential experiments: some algorithms need to use rewards in :math:`[0,1]`, and are easy to use if the rewards known to be in some interval :math:`[a, b]` (I did this from the very beginning here, with ``[lower, lower+amplitude]``).
But if the interval :math:`[a,b]` is unknown, what can we do?
The "Doubling Trick", in this setting, refers to this algorithm:

1. Start with :math:`[a_0, b_0] = [0, 1]`,
2. If a reward :math:`r_t` is seen below :math:`a_i`, use :math:`a_{i+1} = r_t`,
3. If a reward :math:`r_t` is seen above :math:`b_i`, use :math:`b_{i+1} = r_t - a_i`.

Instead of just doubling the length of the interval ("doubling trick"), we use :math:`[r_t, b_i]` or :math:`[a_i, r_t]` as it is the smallest interval compatible with the past and the new observation :math:`r_t`

- Reference.  I'm not sure which work is the first to have proposed this idea, but [[Normalized online learning, St√©phane Ross & Paul Mineiro & John Langford, 2013](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1305.6646.pdf)] proposes a similar idea.

        Let call :math:`r_s` the reward at time :math:`s`, :math:`l_{t-1}` and :math:`a_{t-1}` the lower-bound and amplitude of rewards at previous time :math:`t-1`, and :math:`l_t` and :math:`a_t` the new lower-bound and amplitude for current time :math:`t`.
        The previous history is :math:`R_t := \sum_{s=1}^{t-1} r_s`.

        The generic formula for rescaling the previous history is the following:

        .. math:: R_t := \frac{(a_{t-1} \times R_t + l_{t-1}) - l_t}{a_t}.

        So we have the following efficient algorithm:

        1. If :math:`r < l_{t-1}`, let :math:`l_t = r` and :math:`R_t := R_t + \frac{l_{t-1} - l_t}{a_t}`,
        2. Else if :math:`r > l_{t-1} + a_{t-1}`, let :math:`a_t = r - l_{t-1}` and :math:`R_t := R_t \times \frac{a_{t-1}}{a-t}`,
        3. Otherwise, nothing to do, the current reward is still correctly in :math:`[l_{t-1}, l_{t-1} + a_{t-1}]`, so simply keep :math:`l_t = l_{t-1}` and :math:`a_t = a_{t-1}`.
