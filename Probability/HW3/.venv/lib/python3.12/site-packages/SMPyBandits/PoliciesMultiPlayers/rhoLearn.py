""" rhoLearn: implementation of the multi-player policy from [Distributed Algorithms for Learning..., Anandkumar et al., 2010](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5462144/), using a learning algorithm instead of a random exploration for choosing the rank.

- Each child player is selfish, and plays according to an index policy (any index policy, e.g., UCB, Thompson, KL-UCB, BayesUCB etc),
- But instead of aiming at the best (the 1-st best) arm, player i aims at the rank_i-th best arm,
- At first, every player has a random rank_i from 1 to M, and when a collision occurs, rank_i is given by a second learning algorithm, playing on arms = ranks from [1, .., M], where M is the number of player.
- If rankSelection = Uniform, this is like rhoRand, but if it is a smarter policy, it *might* be better! Warning: no theoretical guarantees exist!

.. note:: This is not fully decentralized: as each child player needs to know the (fixed) number of players.
