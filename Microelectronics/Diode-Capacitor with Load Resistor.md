This circuit uses a diode to emit the negative voltage, and uses a capacitor to smooth the voltage.

The ripple voltage can be calculated using the formula below:

$$V_r = \frac{ I_L T }{ C }$$

- $V_r$: Ripple voltage.
- $I_L$: The current of the load.
- $T$: The period of the input.
- $C$: The capacity of the capacitor.
