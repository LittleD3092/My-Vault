## 2.Please briefly explain how the circuit operates, and measure the current and voltage of R2.

The left side of the circuit is a half-wave rectifier with smoothing capacitor. The negative part is clipped, and the positive part is smoothed.

On the right side, the series of the diodes have lower resistance, so most current flows through the diodes. In the current figure below, you can see that the current is significantly small.

Using many diodes in series can provide better withstand voltage.
