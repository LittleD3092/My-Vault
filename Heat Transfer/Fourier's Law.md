- The heat equation of [[Conduction]].
- Equation: $\displaystyle q_x'' = -k \frac{dT}{dx}$
	- $q_x''$: Heat flux. ${\rm W}/{\rm m^2}$.
	- $dT/dx$: Temperature gradient.
	- $k$: Thermal conductivity. ${\rm W/m \cdot K}$.

# For Steady State Conditions

Under steady state conditions, the temperature distribution is linear

$$\frac{dT}{dx} = \frac{T_2 - T_1}{L}$$

Therefore the heat flux can be simplified to
