# Solid

For solid state:

$$k = \frac 1 3 C \bar c \lambda_{\rm mfp}$$

- $C$: $C \equiv C_e$, the electron specific heat per unit volumn.
- $\bar c$: The mean electron velocity
- $\lambda_{\rm mfp}$: $\lambda_{\rm mfp} \equiv \lambda_e$, the electron mean free path.
	- The average distance travelled by an electron before it collides with something.

For non-conducting solids:

- $C \equiv C_{\rm ph}$, the photon specific heat.
- $\bar c$ is the average speed of sound.
- $\lambda_{\rm mfp} \equiv \lambda_{\rm ph}$, the photon mean free path.

# Fluid

- Includes both liquid and gas.

$$k \approx \frac 1 3 c_v \rho \bar c \lambda_{\rm mfp}$$

- $c_v$: Specific heat capacity.
- $\rho$: Density.
- $\bar c$: Mean molecular speed.
- $\lambda_{\rm mfp}$: Mean free path.

For ideal gas,

$$\lambda_{\rm mfp} = \frac{k_B T}{\sqrt{2}\pi d^2 p}$$

- $k_B$: Boltzmann constant, $k_B = 1.381 \cdot 10^{-23} {\rm J/K}$
- $d$: Diameter of gas molecule.
- $p$: Pressure.
- $T$: Temperature ($\rm K$)
