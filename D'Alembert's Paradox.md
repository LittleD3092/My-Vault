d'Alembert's paradox suggest that:

- The streamlines are symmetry, like the graph (a). 
- The velocity at $A$ and $C$ are low and at $B$ are high. 
- The pressure at $A$ and $C$ are high and at $B$ are low.
- Because the non-slip condition, the friction of the ball is negligible.
- The pressure of point $A$ and $C$ is the same because of symmetry.
- The friction does not cause [[Drag]], and the pressure does not cause [[Drag]]. Therefore, the ball experience no [[Drag]].

The result above is confusing. It means that if the friction is negligible, there is no drag. But in real life, this is not the case. A ball with very high [[Reynolds Number]] still have massive [[Drag]].

After this paradox, Prandtl suggested that even though friction is negligible in general for high-[[Reynolds Number]] flows, there will always be a thin ==boundary layer==:

This boundary layer specified another important concept: ==wake==. The fluid particles slow down in the boundary layer and by the adverse presure gradient (a pressure change opposing fluid motion), and eventually be brought to rest. The wake has low pressure, but the front of the sphere has high pressure. Hence, the sphere will have a large pressure [[Drag]].
