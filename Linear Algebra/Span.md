- Assume we have [[Vector]]s ${\bf v}_1, {\bf v}_2, \dots, {\bf v}_n$ in [[Vector Space]] $V$.
- A **span** is the set of all linear combinations of [[Vector]]s ${\bf v}_1, {\bf v}_2, \dots, {\bf v}_n$.
- The span of ${\bf v}_1, {\bf v}_2, \dots, {\bf v}_n$ is denoted by $\text{Span}({\bf v}_1, {\bf v}_2, \dots, {\bf v}_n)$.
- In section [[Null Space#Example]], the [[Null Space]] $A$ is the span of the vectors $(1, -2, 1, 0)^T$ and $(-1, 1, 0, 1)^T$.
