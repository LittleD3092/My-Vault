Modulation order is the number of different symbols that can be transmitted using the corresponding modulation scheme. (<u>1</u>)

A higher-order modulation will have the following pros and cons: 

- **Pros**: More information bits can be conveyed. (<u>2</u>)
- **Cons**: Requires a higher signal to noise ratio. (<u>3</u>)
