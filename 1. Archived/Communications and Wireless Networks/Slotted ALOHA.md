- The nodes are synchronized to transmit a packet in a time frame.
- If collision happens, retransmit in the following slots with a probability $p$.

Pros:

- Single active node can continuously transmit at a full rate.
- Highly decentralized.
- Simple.

Cons:

- When collision happens, the slot is wasted.
- There are idle slots.
- The nodes require synchronization.
