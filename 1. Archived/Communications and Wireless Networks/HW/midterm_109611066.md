# 1. Definition

## (a) The difference between baseband signals and passband signals

Baseband signals have narrow frequency range, while passband signals are signals that are modulated to occupy a higher frequency range.

## (b) What is a LOS link and a NLOS link

LOS stands for line of sight, and NLOS stands for non line of sight. A LOS link is a direct signal path, and there is no obstacle between the transmitter and the receiver. A NLOS link is an indirect signal path that the signal is reflected (or other interference by the obstacle) before reaching the receiver.

## (c) What is the multipath effect

Multipath effect happens when a signal is received by the receiver by two or more paths. This may cause phase shifting and interference that may cause the signal to become too weak.

## (d) What does a collision event mean? Why a collision event could still occur even if every device listens before talk?

A collision event happens when two or more signals are transmitted at the same time and interfere with each other.

A collision could still occur because of the propagation delay. Even if every device listens before talk, they may not receive the signal from the other device at that time, and thus they may transmit at the same time. In this case, a collision event could still occur.

## (e) Wavelength of a 5GHz channel

The wave length of a signal is given by the formula:

$$
\lambda = \frac{c}{f}
$$

- $c$: speed of light ($3 \times 10^8 m/s$)
- $f$: frequency of the signal

For a 5GHz channel, the wavelength is:

$$
\lambda = \frac{3 \times 10^8}{5 \times 10^9} = 0.06 {\rm \ m} = 6 {\ \rm cm}
$$

## (f) What is channel state information (CSI)? What do $\alpha$ and $\phi$ mean?

Channel state information is the measured properties of a communication link.

- $\alpha$ is the amplitude of the channel.
- $\phi$ is the phase of the channel.

# 2. Medium access control

## (a) Probability that someone can transmit successfully in the second time slot

$$P = p_1(1 - p_2)(1 - p_3) + (1 - p_1)p_2(1 - p_3) + (1 - p_1)(1 - p_2)p_3$$

## (b) Probability that A can transmit successfully in the second time slot

$$P = p_1(1 - p_2)(1 - p_3)$$

## (c) Probability that the second time slot is idle

$$P = (1 - p_1)(1 - p_2)(1 - p_3)$$

## (d) The expected number of time slots for all nodes to transmit their packets

$p$ is the average of $p_1$, $p_2$ and $p_3$:

$$E = 1 + \frac{1}{3p(1 - p)^2} + \frac{1}{2 p(1 - p)} + \frac{1}{p}$$

# 3. Path loss and capacity

## (a) Path loss of a 50m link on a 5GHz channel

$$
\begin{array}{l}
	\displaystyle
	\frac{P_r}{P_t} &=& 
	\displaystyle
	G_tG_r \left( \frac{\lambda}{4\pi d} \right)^2 \\
	&=& 
	\displaystyle
	1 \cdot 1 \cdot \left(
		\frac{
			\displaystyle
			\frac{c}{f}
		}{4 \pi \cdot 50}
	\right)^2 \\
	&=& 
	\displaystyle
	\left(
		\frac{
			\displaystyle
			\frac{3\cdot 10^8}{5 \cdot 10^9}
		}{200\pi}
	\right)^2 \\
	&=& 9.1189 \cdot 10^{-9}
\end{array}
$$

## (b) What is the SNR in dB

The power of transmission in $\rm W$:

$$
\begin{array}{l}
	P_{t, \rm W} &=& 10^{\frac{20}{10}} \cdot 10^{-3} \\
	&=& 10^{-1}
\end{array}
$$

The power of receiving in $\rm W$:

$$
\begin{array}{l}
	P_{r, \rm W} &=& P_{t, \rm W} \cdot 9.1189 \cdot 10^{-9} \\
	&=& 9.1189 \cdot 10^{-10}
\end{array}
$$

The power of the noise in $\rm W$:

$$
\begin{array}{l}
	P_{\rm noise, W} &=& 10^{\frac{-90}{10}} \cdot 10^{-3} \\
	&=& 10^{-12}
\end{array}
$$

The SNR in dB:

$$
\begin{array}{l}
	{\rm SNR}_{\rm dB} &=& \displaystyle 
	10\log_{10} \frac{9.1189\cdot 10^{-10}}{10^{-12}} \\
	&=& 29.6
\end{array}
$$

## (c) The theoretical capacity of the link

$$
\begin{array}{l}
	C &=& B\log_2(1 + {\rm SNR}) \\
	&=& 
	\displaystyle
	20 \cdot 10^6 \log_2 \left(
		1 + \frac{9.1189 \cdot 10^{-10}}{10^{-12}}
	\right) \\
	&=& 196.69 {\ \rm Mb/s}
\end{array}
$$

## (d) Why the coverage range of 5GHz is shorter than 2.4GHz

According to Friis free-space model:

$$
\frac{P_r}{P_t} = G_tG_r 
\left(
	\frac{\lambda}{4\pi d}
\right)^2
$$

If the transmitting and the receiving power is fixed, higher frequency (which means shorter wavelength) will result in a shorter distance.

Therefore, the range of 5GHz channel is shorter than 2.4GHz.

# 4. Modulation and throughput

## (a) Constellation points of QPSK and 16-QAM

For QPSK, the constellation points are:

- $a + ai$
- $-a + ai$
- $-a-ai$
- $a-ai$

with a unknown variable $a$. For the power to be $4$:

$$
\begin{array}{l}
	&\displaystyle 
	\frac{(a^2 + a^2)\cdot 4}{4} = 4 \\
	\implies & a = \sqrt 2
\end{array}
$$

Therefore the constellation points of QPSK are:

- $\sqrt 2 + \sqrt 2 i$
- $-\sqrt 2 + \sqrt 2 i$
- $-\sqrt 2 - \sqrt 2i$
- $\sqrt 2 - \sqrt 2 i$

---

And for 16QAM:

$$
\begin{array}{l}
	& \displaystyle
	\frac{
		8 \cdot (a^2 + 9a^2) +
		4 \cdot (a^2 + a^2) +
		4 \cdot (9a^2 + 9a^2)
	}{16} = 4 \\
	\implies & 
	\displaystyle
	\frac{80a^2 + 8a^2 + 72a^2}{16} = 4 \\
	\implies & 10a^2 = 4 \\
	\implies & a = \displaystyle
	\frac{\sqrt {10}}{5}
\end{array}
$$

The constellation points of 16QAM are:

- $\displaystyle -\frac{3\sqrt {10}}{5} + \frac{3 \sqrt {10}}{5}$
- $\displaystyle -\frac{3\sqrt {10}}{5} + \frac{\sqrt {10}}{5}$
- $\displaystyle -\frac{3\sqrt {10}}{5} - \frac{\sqrt {10}}{5}$
- $\displaystyle -\frac{3\sqrt {10}}{5} - \frac{3 \sqrt {10}}{5}$
- $\displaystyle -\frac{\sqrt {10}}{5} + \frac{3 \sqrt {10}}{5}$
- $\displaystyle -\frac{\sqrt {10}}{5} + \frac{\sqrt {10}}{5}$
- $\displaystyle -\frac{\sqrt {10}}{5} - \frac{\sqrt {10}}{5}$
- $\displaystyle -\frac{\sqrt {10}}{5} - \frac{3 \sqrt {10}}{5}$
- $\displaystyle \frac{\sqrt {10}}{5} + \frac{3 \sqrt {10}}{5}$
- $\displaystyle \frac{\sqrt {10}}{5} + \frac{\sqrt {10}}{5}$
- $\displaystyle \frac{\sqrt {10}}{5} - \frac{\sqrt {10}}{5}$
- $\displaystyle \frac{\sqrt {10}}{5} - \frac{3 \sqrt {10}}{5}$
- $\displaystyle \frac{3\sqrt {10}}{5} + \frac{3 \sqrt {10}}{5}$
- $\displaystyle \frac{3\sqrt {10}}{5} + \frac{\sqrt {10}}{5}$
- $\displaystyle \frac{3\sqrt {10}}{5} - \frac{\sqrt {10}}{5}$
- $\displaystyle \frac{3\sqrt {10}}{5} - \frac{3 \sqrt {10}}{5}$

## (b) Why QPSK is less reliable than BPSK

The distances between two neighboring constellation points are different for QPSK and BPSK. Because the distance is longer for BPSK, for a given SNR, QPSK is more likely to demodulate to a wrong constellation point.

## (c) Difference between SER and BER

SER is the error rate for symbols, and BER is the error rate for the bits. Because a symbol can contain multiple bits, SER and BER can be different.

Even if a symbol has error, it doesn't mean that every bit in the symbol has error. Therefore the BER is smaller than or equal to the SER. Typically, BER is smaller.

$$\rm BER \leq SER$$

## (d) Data rate of BPSK, QPSK and 16QAM

Symbols per second:

$$
\frac{1}{4\cdot 10^{-6}} = 250\rm k
$$

Data rate of BPSK:

$$
250{\rm k} \cdot 1{\rm bit/s} = 250{\rm kb/s}
$$

Data rate of QPSK:

$$
250{\rm k} \cdot 2 {\rm bit/s} = 500{\rm kb/s}
$$

Data rate of 16QAM:\rm k

$$
250{\rm k} \cdot 4{\rm bit/s} = 1{\rm Mb/s}
$$

## (e) What is the PDR of each modulation scheme? What is the average throughput if multiple packets are transmitted?

The PDR of BPSK:

$$
\begin{array}{l}
	\rm PDR &=& (1 - \rm BER)^4 \\
	&=& (1 - 0.001)^4 \\
	&=& 0.996
\end{array}
$$

The PDR of QPSK:

$$
\begin{array}{l}
	\rm PDR &=& (1 - \rm BER)^4 \\
	&=& (1 - 0.01)^4 \\
	&=& 0.9606
\end{array}
$$

The PDR of 16QAM:

$$
\begin{array}{l}
	\rm PDR &=& (1 - \rm BER)^4 \\
	&=& (1 - 0.1)^4 \\
	&=& 0.6561
\end{array}
$$

The average throughput of BPSK:

$$
250{\rm kb/s} \cdot 0.996 = 249{\rm kb/s}
$$

The average throughput of QPSK:

$$
500{\rm kb/s} \cdot 0.9606 = 480.3{\rm kb/s}
$$

The average throughput of 16QAM:

$$
1{\rm Mb/s} \cdot 0.6561 = 656.1{\rm kb/s}
$$

# 5. Rate adaptation (AutoRate)

## (a) What is synchronous ACK and asynchronous ACK

Synchronous ACK is the ACK that is sent immediately after SIFS (short interframe space) following the reception of the data frame.

Asynchronous ACK is the ACK that is sent after DIFS (Distributed Interframe Space) following the reception of the data frame.

## (b) Difference between transmitter-based rate adaptation and receiver-based rate adaptation

Transmitter-based rate adaptation is the rate adaptation that is done by the transmitter. The transmitter decides the rate of the transmission. This kind of rate adaptation is simpler but not as accurate as receiver-based rate adaptation.

Receiver-based rate adaptation is the rate adaptation that is done by the receiver. The receiver can measure the channel state information (CSI) and decide the rate of the transmission. This kind of rate adaptation is more accurate but more complex.

## (c) Give a pros and cons of receiver-based rate adaptation

- Pros: More accurate because the receiver can measure the channel state information (CSI).
- Cons: More complex because the receiver has to measure the CSI.

## (d) Give a pros and cons of transmitter-based rate adaptation

- Pros: Simpler because the transmitter can decide the rate of the transmission.
- Cons: Less accurate because the transmitter cannot measure the CSI.

## (e) What is the estimated throughput of r' and r''? Which rate will be selected at time T1 and T2?

Transmission time of r':

$$
\begin{array}{l}
	\rm T_{\rm r'} &=& \displaystyle
	\frac{L \cdot 1}{r'} + 20\mu s \\
	&=& \displaystyle
	\frac{2000}{10 \cdot 10^6} + 20 \mu s \\
	&=& 0.22{\rm ms}
\end{array}
$$

Throughput of r':

$$
\begin{array}{l}
	\rm Throughput_{\rm r'} &=& \displaystyle
	\frac{L}{T_{\rm r'}} \\
	&=& \displaystyle
	\frac{2000}{0.22 \times 10^{-3}} \\
	&=& 9.09{\rm Mb/s}
\end{array}
$$

Transmission time of r'':

$$
\begin{array}{l}
	\rm T_{\rm r''} &=& \displaystyle
	\frac{L \cdot 2}{r''} + 2 \cdot 20\mu s \\
	&=& \displaystyle
	\frac{2000 \cdot 2}{40 \cdot 10^6} + 40 \mu s \\
	&=& 0.14{\rm ms}
\end{array}
$$

Throughput of r'':

$$
\begin{array}{l}
	\rm Throughput_{\rm r''} &=& \displaystyle
	\frac{L}{T_{\rm r''}} \\
	&=& \displaystyle
	\frac{2000}{0.14 \times 10^{-3}} \\
	&=& 14.29{\rm Mb/s}
\end{array}
$$

---

Transmission time of r at T1:

$$
\begin{array}{l}
	\rm T_{\rm r} &=& \displaystyle
	\frac{L \cdot 6}{r} + 6 \cdot 20\mu s \\
	&=& \displaystyle
	\frac{2000 \cdot 6}{20 \cdot 10^6} + 120 \mu s \\
	&=& 0.72{\rm ms}
\end{array}
$$

Throughput of r at T1:

$$
\begin{array}{l}
	\rm Throughput_{\rm r} &=& \displaystyle
	\frac{L \cdot 5}{T_{\rm r}} \\
	&=& \displaystyle
	\frac{2000 \cdot 5}{0.72 \times 10^{-3}} \\
	&=& 13.89{\rm Mb/s}
\end{array}
$$

Because the throughput of r is higher than r', r will be selected at T1.

Transmission time of r at T2:

$$
\begin{array}{l}
	\rm T_{\rm r} &=& \displaystyle
	\frac{L \cdot 13}{r} + 13 \cdot 20\mu s \\
	&=& \displaystyle
	\frac{2000 \cdot 13}{20 \cdot 10^6} + 260 \mu s \\
	&=& 1.56{\rm ms}
\end{array}
$$

Throughput of r at T2:

$$
\begin{array}{l}
	\rm Throughput_{\rm r} &=& \displaystyle
	\frac{L \cdot 11}{T_{\rm r}} \\
	&=& \displaystyle
	\frac{2000 \cdot 11}{1.56 \times 10^{-3}} \\
	&=& 14.10{\rm Mb/s}
\end{array}
$$

Because the throughput of r'' is higher than r, r'' will be selected at T2.

# 6. Packet detection and equalization

## (a) What is packet detection

Packet detection is the process to detect the start of the packet. This is important because the receiver has to know when the packet starts.

## (b) How to use preamble to perform packet detection in WiFi

The preamble is a sequence of bits that will be at the start of the packet. There will be two preambles in the start.

The receiver will use two sliding windows and compare the contents in the windows. If the contents are the same, this means that this is the preamble, and the receiver will know that this is the start of the packet.

## (c) What is channel estimation

Channel estimation is the process of using the preamble to estimate the channel state information (CSI). This is important because the receiver has to know the channel state information to demodulate the signal.

## (d) What is the estimated channel

The average of the preambles:

$$
\frac{
	(2.7 + 0.3i) + (2 - 0.4i) + (2.5 + 0.1i)
}{
	3
} = 2.4 + 0.0i
$$

The estimated channel:

$$
\begin{array}{l}
	h &=& \displaystyle
	\frac{2.4 + 0.0i}{-1 + 0i} \\
	&=& -2.4
\end{array}
$$

## (e) What are the decoded samples of the three received samples

The decoded sample of the first received sample:

$$
\frac{2.5 + 0.6i}{-2.4} = -1.04 - 0.25i
$$

The decoded sample of the second received sample:

$$
\frac{-1.5 - 0.12i}{-2.4} = 0.625 + 0.05i
$$

The decoded sample of the third received sample:

$$
\frac{2 + 0.8i}{-2.4} = -0.833 - 0.333i
$$

## (f) What is the demodulated samples of the three decoded samples? What is the decoding error of each sample? What is the average decoding SNR?

The demodulated bits:

$$
0, 1, 0
$$

The decoding error of the first sample:

$$
\begin{array}{l}
	& (-1.04 - 0.25i) - (-1) \\
	= & -0.04 - 0.25i
\end{array}
$$

The decoding error of the second sample:

$$
\begin{array}{l}
	& (0.625 + 0.05i) - 1 \\
	= & -0.375 + 0.05i
\end{array}
$$

The decoding error of the third sample:

$$
\begin{array}{l}
	& (-0.833 - 0.333i) - (-1) \\
	= & 0.167 - 0.333i
\end{array}
$$

The average decoding SNR:

$$
\begin{array}{l}
	\rm SNR &=& \displaystyle
	\frac{1}{
		\frac{0.04^2 + 0.25^2 + 0.375^2 + 0.05^2 + 0.167^2 + 0.333^2}{3}
	} \\
	&=& 8.67
\end{array}
$$

## (g) What is the channel coherence time

The channel coherence time is the time that the channel remains constant before changing significantly.

## (h) In static or mobile should the transmitter re-estimate the channel more often? Why?

In mobile, the transmitter should re-estimate the channel more often. This is because the channel is changing more frequently in mobile than in static.
