## 1. What is the full name of MIMO?

MIMO stands for Multiple Input Multiple Output. It is a math model that uses multiple antennas on a single device to increase the capacity.

## 2. What is "Space diversity"?

Space diversity is also called antenna diversity. It is a category of schemes that use two or more antennas to improve the quality and reliability by mitigating multipath effects.

## 3. What does MxN MIMO mean?

$M$ is the number of antennas on the transmitter's device, and $N$ is the number of antennas on the receiver's device. $N$ must be greater than $M$ to retrieve the original signal $x_i$.

## 4. What is the maximum number of streams supported in a 4x4 MIMO system?

Because each combination of transmitting antenna and receiving antenna can form a link, the number of streams supported in a 4x4 MIMO system is:

$$4 \times 4 = 16$$
