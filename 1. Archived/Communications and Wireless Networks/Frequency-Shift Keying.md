![[Frequency-shift keying example.png|300]]

Frequency-shift keying switches between frequencies to transmit data. (<u>1</u>)

Below is a figure that illustrates **BFSK (Binary FSK)**: (<u>2</u>)

Pros:

- Easy to implement.
- Better noise immunity than [[Amplitude-Shift Keying]].

Cons:

- Low data rate compared to better modulation scheme.
- Requires higher bandwidth compared to better modulation scheme.
