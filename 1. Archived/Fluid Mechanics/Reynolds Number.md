We can estimate whether or not viscous forces, as opposed to pressure forces, are negligible by simply computing the Reynolds number

$$Re = \rho \frac{VL}{\mu}$$

- $\rho$: The fluid density.
- $\mu$: [[Viscosity]].
- $V$: The characteristic velocity of the flow.
- $L$: The characteristic size scale of the flow.

If the Reynolds number is large, viscous effects will be small.
If the Reynolds number is small, viscous effects will be dominant.
If the Reynolds number is neither large nor small, both are important.

# Meaning of Reynolds Number

Reynolds number represents the ratio of inertia to viscous forces.
