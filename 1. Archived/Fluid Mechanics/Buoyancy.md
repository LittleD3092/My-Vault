If an object is immersed in a liquid, or floating on its surface, the net vertical force acting on it due to liquid pressure is termed ==buoyancy==.

We can compute the pressure $p$ at depth $h$ in a liquid:

$$p = p_0 + \rho g h$$

The net vertical pressure force on the element is then

$$dF_z = (p_0 + \rho g h_2)dA - (p_0 + \rho g h_1)dA = \rho g(h_2 - h_1)dA$$

And because $(h_2 - h_1)dA = dV$

$$F_z = \int dF_z = \int_V \rho gdV = \rho g V$$

$$\underline{F_{\text{buoyancy}} = \rho g V}_\#$$
