The most efficient cycle that can operate between two constant temperature reservoirs.

# Four Reversible Processes

## (a) Isothermal Expansion (Heating) (1 $\rightarrow$ 2)

# Carnot Principles

1. It is impossible to construct an engine that is more efficient than a reversible engine
2. All engines that operate on the Carnot Cycle between two given constant temperature reservoirs have the same efficiency

# [[Thermal Efficiency]] $\eta$ in Temperature Scale

From Carnot Principle: 
$$\eta_{ th } = f(T_H, T_L)$$
$$\eta_{ th } = 1 - \frac{ Q_L }{ Q_H }$$
$$\implies \frac{ Q_L }{ Q_H } = \phi(T_H, T_L)$$
$$\implies \underline{ \frac{ Q_L }{ Q_H } = \frac{ T_L }{ T_H } }_{ \# }$$
$$\underline{ \eta_{ th } = 1 - \frac{ T_L }{ T_H } }_{ \# }$$
$$COP_{ R } = \frac{ Q_L }{ Q_H - Q_L } = \frac{ T_L }{ T_H - T_L }$$
$$COP_{ H } = \frac{ Q_H }{ Q_H - Q_L } = \frac{ T_H }{ T_H - T_L }$$

> - Efficiency of a Carnot Cycle is only depends on the reservoir temperature
> - higher temperature $\rightarrow$ higher quality
