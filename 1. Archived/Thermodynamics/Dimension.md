# Thermodynamics

物理量([[Property (thermodynamic) | property]])的單位，也叫做因次

## Fundamental(Primary) Dimensions

基礎的物理單位，如質量 $m$ 、長度 $L$ 、時間 $t$ 、溫度 $t$

## Secondary(Derived) Dimensions

以 [[#Fundamental Primary Dimensions]] 為基礎描述的物理量，如速度 $V$ 、能量 $E$ 、體積 $V$

# Mechanical Engineering Design

## Terms

- ==Nominal size==: The size we use in speaking of an element. This is different to the actual size.
- ==Limits==: The stated maximum and minimum dimensions.
- ==Tolerance==: The difference between the two limits.
- ==Bilateral tolerance==: The variation in both directions from the basic dimension. For example, $1.0005 \pm 0.002 \text{ in.}$.
- ==Unilateral tolerance==: Variation is permitted in only one direction, for example, $1.005^{+0.004}_{-0.000} \text{ in}$.
- ==Clearance==: Mating of cylindrical parts, such as a bolt and a hole. Clearance is only used when the internal member is smaller than the external member.
	- ==Diametral clearance==: The measured difference in the two diameters.
	- ==Radial clearance==: The difference in the two radii.
- ==Interference==: The opposite of clearance.
- ==Allowance==: The minimum stated clearance or the maximum stated interference for mating parts.
- ==Fit==: The amount of clearance or interference.
