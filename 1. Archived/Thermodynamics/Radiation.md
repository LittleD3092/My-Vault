- 輻射
- transfer of heat due to electromagnetic waves
- All surfaces of finite temperature emit energy in this form.

# Stefan-Boltzmann Law

[[Stefan-Boltzmann Law]]

# Law of Transfer

$$\dot{ Q } = \varepsilon \sigma A T_s^4$$

- $\varepsilon$: [[Surface Emissivity]] 表面放射率
- $\sigma$: Stefan Boltzmann Constant $5.67 \times 10^{ -8 } W/m^2K^4$
- $A$: [[Surface]] Area
- $T_s$: [[Surface]] Temperature
