# Definition

$$W = \int_1^2 F\cdot dx$$

Work is force acting through a displacement

# Types of Work

## Thermodynamics

- [[Shaft Work]]
- [[Gravitational Work]]
- [[Acceleration Work]]
- [[Moving Boundary of Work]]

## Dynamics

### Work of a Spring Force

$$U_{ 1 - 2 } = \int_{ s_1 }^{ s_2 } F_s ds = \int_{ s_1 }^{ s_2 }-ksds$$

$$\implies U_{ 1 - 2 } = -(\frac{ 1 }{ 2 }ks_2^2 - \frac{ 1 }{ 2 }ks_1^2)$$
