- 傳導
- Transfer of heat between molecules
- Governed by [[Fourier's Law]]
	- Heat rate: $\displaystyle q_x = -kA \frac{dT}{dx}$
	- Heat flux: $\displaystyle q_x'' = -k \frac{dT}{dx}$
- Direction: Always perpendicular to the isothermal surface.
	- Isothermal surface: A surface of constant temperature.

# General Heat Flux

In 3D:

$$q'' = -k \nabla T = -k 
\left(
	{\bf i} \frac{\partial T}{\partial x} +
	{\bf j} \frac{\partial T}{\partial y} +
	{\bf k} \frac{\partial T}{\partial z}
\right)$$

- $k$: Thermal conductivity (${\rm W/m \cdot K}$)
- $T$: Temperature gradient
- ${\bf i, j, k}$: Unit vectors in $x, y, z$ directions

By direction:

$$
\left\{
	\begin{array}{}
		\displaystyle
		q_x'' = -k \frac{\partial T}{\partial x} \\
		\displaystyle
		q_y'' = -k \frac{\partial T}{\partial y} \\
		\displaystyle
		q_z'' = -k \frac{\partial T}{\partial z}
	\end{array}
\right.
$$

> In this section, we assume the medium is isotropic.
> - Isotropic: The thermal conductivity is independent of the coordinate direction.

# Thermal Properties of Matter

- The **transport property** shows how well a material transfer heat.
- Properties:
	- [[Thermal Conductivity]] $k$
	- [[Thermal Diffusivity]] $\alpha$

# Heat Diffusion Equation

- [[Heat Diffusion Equation]]

# Thermal Resistance

Similar to electrical resistance, we can use the concept of [[Thermal Resistance]].

- [[Thermal Resistance]]
