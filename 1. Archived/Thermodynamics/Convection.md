- Transfer of heat from a [[Surface]] to a ==flowing== media.
- Two mechanisms:
	- Random molecular motion.
	- Macroscopic motion of fluid.
- Recall that there is [[Boundary Layer|boundary layer]]:
	- ![[Pasted image 20230222201813.png]]
- Rate equation: $q'' = h(T_s - T_\infty)$
	- $h$: Convection heat transfer coefficient.

# Convection Heat Transfer Coefficient

Some typical values:

| Process                                          | $h(\rm W/m^2 \cdot K)$ |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| Free convection                                  |                        |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gases                   | 2~25                   |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Liquids                 | 50~1000                |
| Forces convection                                |                        |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gases                   | 25~250                 |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Liquids                 | 100~20,000             |
| Convection with phase change                     |                        |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Boiling or condensation | 2500~100,000           |
