This theory is the brittle version of [[Ductile Coulomb-Mohr]]. Written as design equations for a brittle material, they are:

$$
\begin{array}{}
	\displaystyle \sigma_A = \frac{S_{ut}}{n} & \text{if }\sigma_A \geq \sigma_B \geq 0 \\
	\displaystyle \frac{\sigma_A}{S_{ut}} - \frac{\sigma_B}{S_{uc}} = \frac 1 n & \text{if } \sigma_A \geq 0 \geq \sigma_B \\
	\displaystyle \sigma_B = -\frac{S_{uc}}{n} & \text{if } 0 \geq \sigma_A \geq \sigma_B
\end{array}
$$

The following figure shows three ductile [[Failure Theories]] envelope for comparison.
