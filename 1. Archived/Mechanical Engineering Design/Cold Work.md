Also known as strain hardened. This process creates a longer linear elastic curve, and therefore prevent [[Fatigue]] failures. The process contains following [[#Steps]].

The changes made to a metal by cold working can be reversed by subjecting that metal to a particular temperature for a particular amount of time. This process is known as ==annealing==.

To measure how much cold work a material received, we use the change in cross-sectional area of specimen. This measurement is known as "percent cold work".

$$\% CW = [A_0 - A_f] / A_0 \times 100\%$$

# Steps

1. The ambient temperature is below the recrystalization temperature of the material.
2. Loading to point $i$ beyond yield point, then unloading, causing permanent deformation.
3. The curve has been modified that there is a longer linear curve, like the dash line part of the following graph.

Now reloading to $i$ bahaves elastically all the way up to $i$.

# Cons

The area of the material decreases, also make the ductile material more brittle.
