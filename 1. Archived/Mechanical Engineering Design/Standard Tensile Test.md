This is a way to analysis in [[Design Process#4 Analysis and Optimization]].

Standard tensile test is used to obtain material characteristics and [[Strength]]s. The sample is loaded in tension with slowly increasing stress, and the load and deflection are recorded.

The samples used in this test has a regulated shape. You may find the shape regulations on the internet, regulated by ASTM.

## [[Stress-Strain Diagram]]

The test will generate a relationship between stress and strain, often represented in a diagram called "[[Stress-Strain Diagram]]".
