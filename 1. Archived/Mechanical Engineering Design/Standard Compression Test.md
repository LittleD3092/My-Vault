![[standard tensile test - standard tensile test.png|200]]

This is a way to analysis in [[Design Process#4 Analysis and Optimization]].

There are [[Standard Tensile Test]], of course there will be standard compression test. But the [[Standard Tensile Test]] is more common and useful.

# Compression [[Strength]]

- For ductile materials, usually $S_{uc} = S_{ut}$
- For brittle materials, usually $S_{uc} > S_{ut}$. This is because tension force scales up the flaw of the brittle sample.
