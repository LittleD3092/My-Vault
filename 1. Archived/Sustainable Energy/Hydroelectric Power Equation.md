The power that a hydroelectric turbine can produce: (<u>1</u>)

$$
P = \rho \phi gh
$$

- $P$: Power in $\text W$.
- $\rho$: Water density in $\text{kg/m}^3$.
- $\phi$: The rate of water flow in $\text{m}^3\text{/s}$.
- $g$: The constant $9.8\text{ m/s}^2$.
- $h$: The height (head) in $m$.

# Example

A community plans to develop a small scale hydroelectric facility. It is anticipated that the facility will supply electricity to $800$ homes, where the average power consumption per home is $1.5 \text{ kW}$. The facility will utilize a river with a width of $10 \text{ m}$, a depth of $2.5\text{ m}$ and an average flow rate of $2 \text{ m/s}$. The head associated with the dam is $6\text{ m}$ and the generator efficiency is $87\%$. Is this a reasonable plan? (<u>2</u>)

The power needed:

$$P_{\text{required}} = 800 \cdot 1.5 \text{ kW} = 1.2 \text{ MW}$$

The power produced:

$$
\begin{array}{l}
	P &=& \rho \phi gh \\
	&=& 1000 \text{ kg/m}^3 \cdot (10 \cdot 2.5\cdot 2) \text{ m}^3\text{/s} \cdot 9.8 \text{m/s}^2 \cdot 6 \text{ m} \\
	&=& 2.94 \text{ MW}
\end{array}$$

Yes, this is a reasonable plan.
