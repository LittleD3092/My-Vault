Ronen fissile rule can be used to determine whether a material is fissile. This rules applies with few exceptions. (<u>1</u>)

For a heavy element with: (<u>1</u>)

$$90 \leq  Z \leq 100$$

- $Z$: Atomic number.

If the following formula satisfies, the material is fissile: (<u>1</u>)

$$2 \times Z - N = 43 \pm 2$$

- $Z$: Number of protons.
- $N$: Number of neutrons.

# Periodic Table

A periodic table might be useful when determining fissile or not: (<u>2</u>)
