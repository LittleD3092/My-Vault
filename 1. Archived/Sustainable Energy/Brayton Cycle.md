Brayton cycle is a thermodynamic cycle that describes the operation of heat engines. (<u>1</u>)

A Brayton engine consists of 3 **components**: (<u>1</u>)

- Compressor
- Mixing chamber
- Expander

Brayton cycle has **4 processes**, illustrated in the figure below: (<u>1</u>)

| Index | Name               | Description                                                                                           |
| ----- | ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1     | Isentropic process | Ambient air is drawn into the compressor, and it is pressurized.                                      |
| 2     | Isobaric process   | The compressed air passes through a combustion chamber, and air is heated by the fuel in the chamber. |
| 3     | Isentropic process | The heated and compressed air gives up its energy through a turbine.                                  |
| 4     | Isobaric process   | The air is released into atmosphere, and heat rejection happens.                                      |
