Direct memory access (DMA) is an additional hardware that moves data around. It moves data between:

- I/O <-> RAM
- RAM <-> RAM

| Without DMA                  | With DMA                                                                            |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| CPU has to move data itself. | CPU offloads data movement to DMA, and CPU can do other tasks while DMA moves data. |
