- Known as ==HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP)==.
- A ==web page== consists of objects.
- An ==object== is simply a file.
- Most web pages consist of a ==base HTML file== and several referenced objects.
- ==Web browsers== implement the client side of HTTP, ==web servers== implement the server side.
- Because HTTP server maintains no information about the clients, HTTP is said to be a ==stateless protocol==.

Subtopics:

- [[Non-Persistent HTTP]]
- [[Persistent HTTP]]
- [[HTTP Request Message]]

# Message Format

## Request Message



## Response Message

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK

Content-Length: 6821
Content-Type: text/html

(data data data ...)
```

- It has 3 sections:
	- An initial ==status line==.
		- Has 3 fields:
			- The protocol version field.
			- A status code.
				- `200 OK`: Succeeded.
				- `301 Moved Permanently`: Request object has been permanently moved. The new URL is specified in header `Location`.
				- `400 Bad Request`: Generic error code that the request could not be understood by the server.
				- `404 Not Found`: The requested document does not exist on this server.
				- `505 HTTP Version Not Supported`: The requested HTTP protocol version is not supported by the server.
			- A corresponding status message.
	- Six ==header lines==.
		- `Connection`: Whether to close TCP connection after response.
		- `Date`: Indicates time and date.
		- `Server`: The message was generated by an Apache Web server.
		- `Last-Modified`: Time and date when the object was last modified.
		- `Content-Length`: Number of bytes in the object being sent.

# Cookies

Because HTTP server maintains no information about the clients, HTTP is said to be a stateless protocol. However, it is often desirable for a web site to identify users.

Cookies allow sites to keep track of users, and major commecial web sites use cookies today.

Cookie technology has four components:

1. A cookie header line in the HTTP response message.
2. A cookie header line in the HTTP request message.
3. A cookie file kept on the user's end system and managed by the user's browser.
4. A back-end database at the web site.

The sequence graph is as shown:

In this way, the server host is able to track client's activity. Although server does not know the name of the client, it knows that `ID 1678` comes and visit its site.

[[Proxy]]

# HTTP/2

The HTTP/1.1 we discussed has a ==head of line (HOL) blocking== problem because of [[#Persistent Connections]]. The link is occupied by client, and other hosts cannot use it.
