In addition to [[#Delay]] and packet loss, another critical performance is the throughput. It is the file size $F$ divided by times taken to transfer $T$, $F / T$.

- The ==instantaneous throughput== at any instant of time is the rate at which host $\text B$ is receiving the file.
- The ==average throughput== of the file transfer is $F / T \text{bits/sec}$.
- The throughput is the transmission rate of the ==bottleneck link== (the link with the least rate).
