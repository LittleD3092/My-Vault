> A ==protocol== defines the format and the order of messages exchanged between two or more communicating entities, as well as the actions taken on the transmission and/or receipt of a message or other event.

The devices need a way of communicating with others, this communication method is called protocols. Protocols control sending and receiving of messages. All communication activities in [[Internet]] are governed by protocols.

Some common protocols:

- http
- streaming video
- skype
- TCP
- IP
- wifi
- 4G
- Ethernet

# Application-Layer Protocols

An application-layer protocol defines:

- The syntax of the various message types, such as the fields in the message and how the fields are delineated.
- The semantics of the fields, that is, the meaning of the information in the fields.
- Rules for determining when and how a process sends messages and responds to messages.
