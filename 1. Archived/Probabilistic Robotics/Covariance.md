Covariance is the squared expected deviation $\sigma^2$, often denoted $\Sigma$. For example, [[Normal Distribution|normal distribution]] can also be written as:

$$\mathcal{N}(x; \mu, \Sigma)$$

The covariance of random variable $X$ can be obtained:

$$
\begin{array}{}
	\text{Cov}[X] &=&
	E[X - E[X]]^2 \\
	&=& E[X^2] - E[X]^2
\end{array}$$
