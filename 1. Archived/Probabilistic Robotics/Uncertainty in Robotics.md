Uncertainty arises if the robot lacks critical information for carrying out its task. There are 5 factors that cause uncertainty:

- **Environments**: The unpredictable real world.
- **Sensors**: Noise, range and resolution of sensors.
- **Robots**: The motors and their positions are unpredictable.
- **Models**: An abstraction of the real world.
- **Computation**: Most algorithms are approximate, achieving real-time response.
