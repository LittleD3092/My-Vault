Distributed Denial of Service Attack (DDoS) is an advanced version of traditional Denial of Service Attack (DoS) that it is a group-based attack behavior. (<u>1</u>)

The steps of the attack have similar procedures: (<u>1</u>)

1. A cluster of PCs are used to initiate the attack.
2. Some randomly distributed IP addresses are used to conceal the attack.
3. The structure of the packets are changed randomly to hide the attacking packets among the legal packets.
4. The bugs and weakness of the server is being detected.
5. The attack become more intense while the characteristics of the attacking packets are hard to detect.

Subtopics:

- [[Signature-Based Detection]]
- [[Anomaly Detection]]
