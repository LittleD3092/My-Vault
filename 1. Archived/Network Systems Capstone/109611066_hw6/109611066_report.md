# Part 1: Creating the SDN Network

## 1. When h1 ping h2, what will happen?

![[Pasted image 20240502142807.png]]

ARP:
h1 sent request
h2 received and replied
h1 received the reply
ICMP:
h1 sent request
h2 received and replied
h1 received the reply

## 2. When h1 ping h3, what will happen?

![[Pasted image 20240502143448.png]]

ARP:
h1 sent request
h3 received and replied
h1 received the reply
ICMP:
h1 sent request
h3 received and replied
h1 didn't receive the reply because the flow tables (`filter_table_1` and `filter_table_2` to be specific) specified that packets identified as an ICMP packet and comming from `port_3` and `port_4` should be dropped.

## 3. When h3 ping h2, what will happen?

![[Pasted image 20240502145517.png]]

ARP:
h3 sent request
h2 received and replied
h3 received the reply
ICMP:
h3 sent request
h2 didn't receive the request because the request was an ICMP and was coming from port 3, and therefore was dropped.

## 4. When h1 ping h5, what will happen?

Both ARP and ICMP cannot get through, because the switches are not connected.

## 5. When h1 ping h5, what will happen?

![[Pasted image 20240502192513.png]]

ARP:
h1 sent request
h5 received and replied
h1 received the reply
ICMP:
h1 sent request
h5 received and replied
h1 received the reply

## 6. When h1 ping h7, what will happen?

Screenshot from vm1:

![[Pasted image 20240502192720.png]]

Screenshot from vm2:

![[Pasted image 20240502192807.png]]

ARP:
h1 sent request
h7 received and replied
h1 received the reply
ICMP:
h1 sent request
h7 received and replied
h1 didn't receive, because the packet is dropped by s2

## 7. When h7 ping h1, what will happen?

Screenshot from vm2:

Screenshot from vm1:

![[Pasted image 20240502193147.png]]

ARP:
h7 sent request
h1 received and replied
h7 received the reply
ICMP:
h7 sent request
h1 didn't receive the request, because the packet is dropped by s2.

## 8. If the packet in Question 6 or 7 is dropped in some part of the network, are the outcome and explanation the same as that of Question 4?

Let's first compare the results of question 6 and question 4:

|     | Question 6 (h1 ping h7)              | Question 4 (h1 ping h5)              |
| --- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| vm1 | ![[Pasted image 20240502192720.png]] | ![[Pasted image 20240502192300.png]] |
| vm2 | ![[Pasted image 20240502192807.png]] | ![[Pasted image 20240502192314.png]] |
|     |                                      |                                      |

**Outcome**:

- **Question 6**: The ARP packet can go through the topology, and the ICMP request packet too. However, the ICMP response packet cannot go through, so the ping failed.
- **Question 4**: The ARP packet cannot go through the topology, so the ping failed.

**Explaination**:

- **Question 6**: The ICMP response packet cannot go through because it is sent by h7, to the port 3 of s2. The `filter_table_2` is configured to drop packets that came from port 3 or 4, so the response packet cannot go through.
- **Question 4**: Because the two switches is not connected in any ways, so the ARP packet cannot be sent to vm2.

Then let's compare the results of question 7 and question 4:

|     | Question 7 (h7 ping h1)              | Question 4 (h1 ping h5)              |
| --- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| vm1 | ![[Pasted image 20240502193147.png]] | ![[Pasted image 20240502192300.png]] |
| vm2 | ![[Pasted image 20240502193103.png]] | ![[Pasted image 20240502192314.png]] |
**Outcome**:

- **Question 7**: The ARP packet can go through the topology, but the ICMP request cannot go through the topology. Therefore the ping failed.
- **Question 4**: The ARP packet cannot go through the topology, so the ping failed.

**Explaination**:

- **Question 7**: The ICMP request packet cannot go through because it is sent by h7, to the port 3 of s2. The `filter_table_2` is configured to drop packets that came from port 3 or 4, so the request packet cannot go through.
- **Question 4**: Because the two switches is not connected in any ways, so the ARP packet cannot be sent to vm2.

We can see that the outcomes and explanations for question 6 and 7 are not the same as question 4. In question 4, the tunnel is not established, so the ARP packet cannot go through. In question 6 and 7, the ARP packet can get through since the tunnel is established, but the ICMP packet (request for question 7 or response for question 6) cannot go through due to the configuration of `filter_table_2`.

## 9. Change filter_table_2 rule

There is a key difference between the original rule and the new rule. It is that whether the port used as the tunnel will be dropped or not.

| Rule          | Specification                                                                                      | Packets coming from tunnel port? |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Original Rule | Packets coming from port_3 or port_4 will be dropped, while other packets will be allowed to pass. | Will be allowed to pass.         |
| New Rule      | Packets coming from port_1 or port_2 will be allowed to pass, while other packets will be dropped. | Will be dropped.                 |

For packets coming from port 1 to 4, the rules don't change when switching to the new rule. But the packets coming from the GRE tunnel port will be dropped if the new rule is used.

Using the new rules, we will observe that the outcomes of question 5 and 6 will differ, that the ICMP request will be dropped. For question 7, the outcomes will be the same that the ICMP request will be dropped.
