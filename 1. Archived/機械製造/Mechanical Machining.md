- Water Resistance

# Milling

Milling is a basic machining process by which a [[Surface]] is generated by progressive chip removal.

## 3 Board Categories

1. peripheral milling: performed on a horizontal-spindle milling machine

### Probable Cause

| Probable Cause                                             | Cures                                                           |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Lack of rigidity in machine, fixtures, arbor, or workpiece | Use larger arbors                                               |
| Cutting load too great                                     | Change rpm (cutting speed)                                      |
| Dull cutter                                                | Decrease feed per tooth or number of teeth in contact with work |
| Poor lubrication                                           | Sharpen or replace inserts                                      |
| Straight-tooth cutter                                      | Flood coolant                                                   |
| Radial relief too great                                    | Use helical cutter                                              |
| Rubbing, insufficient clearance                            | Check tool angles                                               |
