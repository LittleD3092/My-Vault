- Classful network is an obsolete network addressing architecture before [[Classless Interdomain Routing]].
- This method divides the IP addresses into five classes:

| Classes | Purpose                   | Default Subnet Mask   |
| ------- | ------------------------- | ------------- |
| Class A | [[Unicast]] addresses.    | `255.0.0.0`   |
| Class B | [[Unicast]] addresses.    | `255.255.0.0` |
| Class C | [[Unicast]] addresses.    | `255.255.255.0`              |
| Class D | [[Multicast]] networking. | not defined              |
| Class E | Reserved.                 | not defined              |
