Vector Space is made from:

1. Set of all vectors with same number of components $n$ as the dimension of $V$.
2. Scalar numbers.
3. Algebraic operators (Vector Addition, Vector Multiplication).

For $V$ to be a vector space, it needs to satisfy the closure properties:

- If ${\bf x} \in V$ and $\alpha$ is a scalar, then $\alpha {\bf x}\in V$.
- If ${\bf x}, {\bf y} \in V$, then ${\bf x} + {\bf y} \in V$.
