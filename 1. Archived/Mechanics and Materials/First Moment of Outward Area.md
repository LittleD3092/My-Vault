$$Q = \int_y^c y dA = \text{ first moment of outward area }$$

# Rectangle

For a rectangle, the first moment of outward area is 

$$Q(y_1) = \frac b 2 \left(\frac{h^2}{4} - y_1^2\right)$$

Where $y_1$ is the axis of your desire, $b$ is the depth of rectangle cross-section, $h$ is the height of rectangle.
