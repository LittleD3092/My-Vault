# Maximum Stress

$$\underline{ \sigma_{ \text{ max } } = \frac{ Mc }{ I } }_{ \# } \qquad \text{ (c is the furthest distance on the cross section from the neutral axis) }$$

# Two-plane Bending

For a beam that has two axis of stress applied on it, the formula becomes the following.

$$\sigma_x = -\frac{M_zy}{I_z} + \frac{M_yz}{I_y}$$
