Hooke's law for a material is the following equation:

$$\sigma = E\varepsilon$$

It is similar to the one that illustrates springs.

$E$: [[Stiffness (young's modulus)]]

# Generalized Hooke's Law

While you have multiple stress in different axis, the hooke's law become more complicated and the [[Poisson's Ratio]] has to be taken into account.

By [[Hooke's Law]] and [[Poisson's Ratio]], we can get the relationship below:
$$
\left\{
	\begin{array}{}
		\varepsilon_x = \frac 1 E[\sigma_x - v(\sigma_y + \sigma_z)] \\
		\varepsilon_y = \frac 1 E[\sigma_y - v(\sigma_x + \sigma_z)] \\
		\varepsilon_z = \frac 1 E[\sigma_z - v(\sigma_y + \sigma_x)]
	\end{array}
\right.
$$
