This is the most realistic equation for rendering.

$$
\begin{array}{}
	\text{Outgoing} - \text{Incoming} = \text{emitted} - \text{absorbed} \\
	\text{Outgoing} = \text{emitted} + \text{reflected} + \text{transmitted}
\end{array}
$$

However, this means that we are calculating global illumination, and this is too slow.
