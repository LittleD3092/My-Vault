The ambient light of [[Phong Reflection Model|Phong reflection model]] can be calculated:

$${\bf l}_\text{ambient} = {\bf K}_a \cdot {\bf l}_a$$

- ${\bf K}_a$: Reflection ratio.
- ${\bf l}_a$: Initially applied light.

The meaning of ambient component is the result of **multiple interactions** between large light source and objects.
