**Entity** is an object that **exists** and **distinguishable** from other objects. For example, **a specific student**, **event**, or **department**.

Each entity is represented by a set of attributes, for example:

$$
\begin{array}{l}
	\text{Instructor} = (\text{ID}, \text{name}, \text{salary}) \\
	\text{Course} = (\text{course\_id}, \text{title}, \text{credits})
\end{array}
$$

Therefore, an entity set is a set of entities that have **same type and properties**.
