We can use the following [[Relational Algebra|relational algebra]] formula to test if two decomposed relations are lossless decomposition. If it is true, then it must be lossless decomposition. (<u>1</u>)

$$\Pi_{R_1}(r) \bowtie \Pi_{R_2}(r) = r$$

- $R_1, R_2$: Decomposed relations.
- $r$: Combined relations.
