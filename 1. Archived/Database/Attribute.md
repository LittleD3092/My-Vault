# Relational Model

Attributes are the **columns** of the [[Relational Model]].

- **Domain of attribute**: The set of allowed values. (Ex: `INT`, `VARCHAR`)
- The attributes are **atomic**, they must contain only one information.

The column marked below is an attribute in a table:

# Entity-Relational Model

The attributes in [[Entity-Relational Model]] are different from the ones from [[Relational Model]]. There are 3 kinds of categories:

- **Single and composite** attributes: An attribute can have **elements**.
- **Single-valued and multi-valued** attributes: An attribute can be a **tuple**.
- **Derived value**: An attribute can be a **function** using other attributes as input.
