A schema needs to be normalized. The normalization process is the process of separating the schema:

Depending on how well the schema is normalized, there are multiple normal forms:

- [[First Normal Form]] (1NF)
- [[Second Normal Form]] (2NF)
	- [[Partial Dependency of Database]]
- [[Third Normal Form]] (3NF)
	- [[Transitive Dependency of Database]]
- [[Boyce-Codd Normal Form]] (BCNF)
