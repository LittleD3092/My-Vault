**Data Manipulating Language** (DML) is the language for accessing and updating the data stored.

> Note that:
> - DDL is for defining the data type (creating an empty table).
> - DML is for updating the data stored (modify the content in a table).

There are **two types** of DML, depending on whether user specifies the procedure of getting data:

- **Procedural DML**: Users specify what data is needed and how to get the data.
- **Declarative DML**: Users specify what data is needed. The way of getting data is automatically determined.
