To be more precise, Poisson process can be partitioned into subintervals each with the same length $\Delta t$. And it has the following 3 properties: (<u>1</u>)

1. The probability of two or more events in one subinterval is near 0.
2. The probability of one event in a subinterval is $\lambda / n$.
3. The event in each subinterval is independent of other subintervals.

- [[Poisson Distribution]]
- [[Exponential Distribution]]
