There are two possible ways for testing. We should choose one of them depending on the **sample size** and whether **population standard deviation** is known: (<u>1</u>)

| Testing | Condition                                                                                |
| ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| T-test  | <ol><li>Sample size is small, n < 30 <li>Population standard deviation is unknown</ol>   |
| Z-test  | <ol><li>Sample size is large, n >= 30, or<li>Population standard deviation is known</ol> |
