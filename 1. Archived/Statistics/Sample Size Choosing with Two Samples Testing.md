# Two-sided Test, Known Variance

The choice of sample size for two-sided test on the difference in means, variances known, when $n_1 = n_2$:

$$
n = \frac{(z_{\alpha / 2} + z_\beta)^2 (\sigma_1^2 + \sigma_2^2)}
{
	\Delta - \Delta_0
}
$$

- $z_{\alpha / 2}$: Z value of $\alpha / 2$.
- $z_\beta$: Z value of $\beta$.
- $\sigma_1, \sigma_2$: Popular standard deviation of sample 1 and 2.
- $\Delta$: Difference in mean.
- $\Delta_0$: Difference of null hypothesis.
