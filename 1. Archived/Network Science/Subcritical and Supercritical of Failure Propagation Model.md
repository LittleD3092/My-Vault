- **Subcritical** means that the failure will not propagate. (<u>1</u>)
- **Supercritical** means that the failure will propagate. (<u>1</u>)

The below plot shows the region of supercritical and subcritical: (<u>2</u>)

The colored dots in the plot is the different average degree $\langle k\rangle$. We can see that: (<u>2</u>)

- Higher degree means better tolerance.
- Lower breakdown threshold means nodes break easily.
