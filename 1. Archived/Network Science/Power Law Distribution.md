# Determine Power Law Distribution

[[Scale-free Network|Scale-free network]] has power law distribution (<u>1</u>). Therefore, a new problem appears. How do we **determine whether a network has power law distribution**?

There are 2 methods (<u>1</u>):

- Plot graphs (<u>1</u>):
	- [[Probability Distribution Function]] (<u>2</u>)
	- [[Cumulative Distribution Function in Network Science]] (<u>2</u>)
- Calculate values directly (<u>1</u>):
	- [[Calculate Power Law Distribution]]

# Property of Power Law Distribution

There are a property called **[[Moment of Probability Network|moment]]**. It might provides what degree most nodes have. (<u>1</u>)

- [[Moment of Probability Network|Moment]]

# How to Generate Power Law Distribution

Following networks generates power law distribution (<u>1</u>):

- [[Random Graph]]
- [[Small-world Network]]
- [[Scale-free Network]]
