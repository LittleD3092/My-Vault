The expected number of edges between all pairs of nodes of the same feature: (<u>1</u>)

$$\frac 1 2 \sum_{ij}\frac{k_i k_j}{2m} \delta_{g_i g_j}$$

- $\sum_{ij}$: For each node $i$ and for each node $j$.
- $k_i, k_j$: The degree of node $i$ and $j$.
- $m$: Number of nodes.
- $\delta_{g_i g_j}$: [[Kronecker Delta]].
- $g_i, g_j$: The feature of node $i$ and $j$.
