- A matrix that has 1s on the main diagnal, and 0s elsewhere.
- The $n \times n$ **identity matrix** is the matrix $I = (\delta_{ij})$, where
$$
\delta_{ij} = \left\{
	\begin{array}{}
		1 & \text{if } i = j \\
		0 & \text{if } i \neq j
	\end{array}
\right.
$$
- For any $n \times n$ matrix $A$,
$$IA = AI = A$$
