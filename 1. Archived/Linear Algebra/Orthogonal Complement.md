# Definition

Let $Y$ be a subspace of $R^n$. The set of all vectors in $R^n$ that are orthogonal to every vector in $Y$ will be denoted $Y^\perp$. Thus,

$$Y^\perp = \{{\bf x} \in R^n \ \vert\  {\bf x}^T{\bf y} = 0 \quad \text{for every }{\bf y}\in Y\}$$

The set $Y^\perp$ is called the **orthogonal complement** of $Y$.
