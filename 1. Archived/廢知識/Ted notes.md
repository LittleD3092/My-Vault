# Steps

1. Deconstruct the skill. Deside what you exactly want to do with skill and break the skill, practice the most important skills.
2. Learn enough to correct yourself. Practice just enough to notice when you do mistakes and get on the right path.
3. Remove the distractions. Disable notifications and remove all the distractions.
4. Practice at least 20 hours. Try to do 20 hours of deliberate practice. Stick with it no matter what.

> The major barrier to skill acquisition isn't an intellectual one, but it's emotional.
