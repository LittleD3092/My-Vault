You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `i`th day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return `0`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.
```

# 1. Brute Force

We may just try every possible pair of buy and sell dates in which the buy date precedes the sell date. A period of $n$ days has $C^n_2$ pairs of dates, so the time complexity is $\Theta(n^2)$.

# 2. Transformation

Instead of looking at the daily prices, let us instead consider the daily change in price. 

| Day    | 0   | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   |
| ------ | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Price  | 10  | 11  | 7   | 10  | 6   |
| Change |     | 1   | -4  | 3   | -4  | 

The daily change is shown at the bottom of the chart. If we treat this row as an array $A$, we now want to find the nonempty, contiguous subarray of $A$ whose values have the largest sum. This contiguous subarray is called the ==maximum subarray==. This problem can be found in [[53. Maximum Subarray]].
