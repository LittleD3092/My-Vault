- Equal to the dimensionless temperature gradient at the surface.
- Measure convection heat transfer at the surface.

$$Nu = \frac{hL}{k_f} = 
\left.
	\frac{\partial T^*}{\partial y^*}
\right\vert_{y^* = 0}$$

For a prescribed geometry:

$$Nu = f(x^*, Re_L, Pr)$$

The average Nusselt Number is:

$$\overline{Nu} = \frac{\overline h L}{k_f} = f(Re_L, Pr)$$
