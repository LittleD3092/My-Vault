$$Sh = \frac{h_m L}{D_{AB}} = 
\left.
	\frac{\partial C^*_A}{\partial y^*}
\right\vert_{y^* = 0}$$

- Equal to the dimensionless concentration gradient at the surface.
- Measure of convection mass transfer at the surface.

For a prescribed geometry:

$$Sh = f(x^*, Re_L, Sc)$$

Average Sherwood number:

$$\overline{Sh} = \frac{\overline h_m L}{D_{AB}} = f(Re_L, Sc)$$
