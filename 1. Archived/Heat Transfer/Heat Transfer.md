[TOC]

- Heat transfer (or heat) is thermal energy in transit due to a spatial temperature difference.
- Can be written in **rate equations**.

# Modes

- [[Conduction]]: transfer of heat between molecules
- [[Convection]]: transfer of heat from a [[Surface]] to a ==flowing== media
- [[Radiation]]: transfer of heat due to electromagnetic waves]]

For a surface and its surroundings, [[Convection]] and [[Radiation]] can happen simultaneously.

$$q = q_{\rm conv} + q_{\rm rad} = hA(T_s - T_\infty) + \varepsilon A \sigma (T_s^4 - T_{\rm sur}^4)$$
