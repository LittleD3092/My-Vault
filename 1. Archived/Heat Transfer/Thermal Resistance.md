We can use the concept of thermal resistance to make calculation easier.

**Chart for thermal resistance**:

| Name                              | Equation                                                                                 |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| For [[Conduction]] through a wall | $\displaystyle R_{t, \rm cond} \equiv \frac{T_{s, 1} - T_{s, 2}}{q_x} = \frac{L}{kA}$    |
| For [[Convection]]                | $\displaystyle R_{t, \rm conv} \equiv \frac{T_s - T_\infty}{q} = \frac{1}{hA}$           |
| For [[Radiation]]                 | $\displaystyle R_{t, \rm rad} = \frac{T_s - T_{\rm sur}}{q_{\rm rad}} = \frac{1}{h_r A}$ | 

# Composite Wall



For composite wall, we often use an **overall heat transfer coefficient** $U$:

$$\underline{q_x = UA\Delta T}_\#$$

In general, the total thermal resistance can be written as

$$\underline{R_{\rm tot} = \sum R_t = \frac{\Delta T}{q} = \frac{1}{UA}}_\#$$

For making individual thermal resistances parallel or series, see below figure:
