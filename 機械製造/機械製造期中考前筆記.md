## Measurement and Inspection

### Accuracy and Precise

![[Accuracy and Precise.png]]

### The Rule of Ten

測量的方法必須比所要達到的精度準至少十倍

### Visual Inspection

直接用看的

### Liquid Penetrant Inspection

包含四個步驟

1. 工件有裂痕
2. 將 penetrant 塗上去
	- penetrant 通常是一種顏料，有時也會用有放射性物質或紫外線照射會顯現等顏料以方便辨識
3. 等待 penetrant 滲入裂縫中，並清洗或抹除表面的顏料
4. 塗上 developer
	- developer 是一種具有吸收性的材質，可以把顏料吸到表面以方便辨識

### Magnetic Particle Inspection

- nondestructive testing
- used to detect [[Surface]] and subsurface ([[Surface]] near but not exposed) discontinuities
- used in ferromagnetic materials (iron, nickel, cobalt...)
- use magnetic [[field]] to magnetize material

The presence of discontinuity allows magnetic flux to leak

![[magnetic particle inspection.png]]

#### Direct Magnetization

Electric current is passed through the test object and form a magnetic [[field]]

#### Indirect Magnetization

No electric current is passed through. Magnetic [[field]] is applied from an outside source.

### Ultrasonic Inspection

Uses very short ultrasonic waves (0.1 ~ 15MHz, occasionally up to 50 MHz) to detect internal flaws in materials

Usually on steel and other metals, but can be used on concrete, wood, and composites with less resolution.

![[ultrasonic testing example.png]]

- left:
	- first pulse: initial pulse of probe
	- second pulse: the back wall echo
- right: the crack simultaneously reduce the amplitude of the back wall echo

The depth of the crack can be determined by the ratio $D / E_p$

### Radiography

用 X 光照射

### Eddy-Current Testing

使用不斷改變的磁場，會使工件產生感應電流，並且產生不同的 [[Impedance]]、電流與電壓，因此可以看出表面瑕疵

![[eddy-current testing.png]]

### Acoustic Emission Monitoring

在製造過程中，如果產生 [[Deformation]] 或破裂，工件會發出聲音。這些聲音介於 $20 \sim 1200kHz$ 之間，可以收音並分析是否有斷裂的聲音。

## Shape-Producing Processes

![[Materials Processing]]

## Cross Section of Mold

![[Casting Process]]

## Solidification

There will be some defects in solidification

1. gas porosity
2. shrinkage

> ### Gas Porosity
> 
> the formation of bubbles within the casting after it has cooled.

Solidification contains two stages

1. nucleation
2. growth

### Shrinkage

![[solidification shrinkage.png]]

### Nucleation

當液體變成固體時發生，會形成液體與固體之間的膜。這個過程需要能量，因此實際形成溫度低於熔點

> #### Undercooling
> 
> 熔點與實際形成溫度的差

- 在倒進模子前液體中會有結塊固體，這會幫助 grain 形成

### Growth

熱從液體散失時會收縮，收縮速度會與晶體形成有關，因此我們會希望可以控制熱散失的速度

如果散失速度快，晶體形成較小

### Cooling Curves

![[Casting Process#Cooling Curves]]

當材料是混合物的時候，圖會長這樣

![[phase diagram of alloy with a freezing range.jpg]]

### Chvorinov's Rule

用來推估 Solidification 需要的時間

放出熱量的兩個因素為放熱的表面積與放熱的周遭環境

$$t_s = B(\frac{ V }{ A })^n \qquad \text{ where } n = 1.5 \text{ to } 2.0$$

$t_s$: the time from pouring to solidification
$B$: the mold constant
$V$: the volume of the casting
$A$: the [[Surface]] area through which heat is rejected

### Cast Structure

包含三個區域

1. Chill Zone
	- 在模子的壁上比較冰，因此會產生一層薄的結晶
2. Columnar Zone
	- 細長、垂直於模子的璧
3. Equiaxed Zone
	- 圓形、隨機分佈的結晶，在內部

## Investment Casting

### Flask-Cast Method

1. Wax or plastic is injected into die to make a pattern.
2. Patterns are gated to a central sprue
3. A metal flask is placed around the pattern cluster
4. Flask is filled with investment-mold slurry
5. After mold material has set and dried, patterns are melted out of mold
6. Hot molds are filled with metal by gravity, pressure, vacuum, or centrifugal force
7. Mold material is broken away from castings
8. Castings are removed from sprue, and gate stubs are ground off

![[Investment casting flask-cast method.png]]

### Shell-Casting Procedure

1. Wax or plastic is injected into die to make a pattern
2. Patterns are gated to a central sprue
3. Pattern clusters are dipped in ceramic slurry
4. Refractory grain is sifted onto coated patterns. Step 3 and 4 are repeated several times to obtain desired shell
5. After mold material has set and dried, patterns are melted out of mold
6. Hot molds are filled with metal by gravity, pressure, vacuum, or centrifugal force
7. Mold material is broken away from castings
8. Castings are removed from sprue, and gate stubs are ground off

![[investment casting shell-casting procedure.png]]

## Lost Foam Process

1. Polystyrene pattern
2. Dipped in refractory slurry
3. Surrounded with loose unbonded sand
4. Compacted by vibration
5. Metal poured onto polystyrene pattern
6. Casting removed and sand reclaimed

![[lost foam process.png]]

## Permanent-Mold Casting

### Process

Mold cavities are machined into mating metal die blocks, which are then preheated and clamped together. Molten metal is then poured into the mold and enters the cavity by gravity flow. After solidification, the mold is opened and the casting is removed.

## Die Casting

Molten metal is injected into closed metal dies under pressure. Pressure is maintained during solidification, after which the dies separate and the casting is ejected along with its attached sqrues and runners. Cores must be simple and retractable and take the form of moving metal segments.
