Suppose we have [[Incidence Matrix|incidence matrix]] $\bf B$, the one-mode projection of it is:

$${\bf P} = {\bf B}{\bf B}^T \quad \text{or} \quad
{\bf P} = {\bf B}^T{\bf B}$$

Depending on the order we multiply matrices, we can have **two** one-mode projection for **two classes**.

- One-mode projection means the **2-step connection** of the network.
