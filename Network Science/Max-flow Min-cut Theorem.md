This theorem suggest that the maximum flow is proportional to the number of [[Connectivity|edge independent path]].

$${\rm max\ flow} = {
	\begin{array}{}
		\rm num\ of\ edge\ \\ 
		\rm independent\ paths
	\end{array}
} \times {
	\begin{array}{}
		\rm the\ max\ flow\ \\ 
		\rm along\ a\ single\ pipe
	\end{array}
}$$
