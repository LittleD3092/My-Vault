Planar network is a network that can be drawn **without edges cross**.

- [[Four Color Theorem]]: The regions separated by network edges need to be colored, and neighbor regions must be different colors. **No more than 4 colors** are required to color the regions.

# Determine a Planar Graph

To determine whether a graph is a planar graph, we can use [[Kuratowski's Theorem|Kuratowski's theorem]].

The theorem suggests that a network is planar if it **contains neither** ${\bf K}_5$ **or** ${\bf K}_{3, 3}$ (${\bf K}_{3, 3}$ is also known as UG, utility graph).
