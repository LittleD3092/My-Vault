Global clustering coefficient, different from [[Local Clustering Coefficient]], shows **the connectivity of all nodes' neighbors**.

It is hard to calculate by hand, so there are [[Average Clustering Coefficient]] to substitute this.

Global clustering coefficient can be defined by counting the triangles and counting number of path of length 2.

$$C = \frac{3 \cdot \text{number of triangles}}{\text{number of 2-length paths}}$$
