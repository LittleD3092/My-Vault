Assortative mixing is a way to assign a score to each division of [[Community|communities]]. After assigning the scores, we can find one division with the maximum score. (<u>1</u>)

Assortative mixing uses the number of [[Intra-edges of Community Network|intra-edges]] to assign the scores. (<u>1</u>)

For each node, there are features like age or gender. Assortative mixing categorizes these features into 2 kinds: (<u>1</u>)

- [[Unordered Features|Unordered features]]
- [[Ordered Features|Ordered features]]

Each of the category has a way of calculating: (<u>1</u>)

- [[Assortative Mixing with Unordered Features]]
	- [[Actual Intra-edges of Network with Unordered Features]]
		- [[Kronecker Delta]]
	- [[Expected Intra-edges of Network with Unordered Features]]
