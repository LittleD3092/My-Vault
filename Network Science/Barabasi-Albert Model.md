To generate BA Model, we follow the steps below:

1. Start with a connected network of $c_0 \geq c$ nodes.
2. Each time, **add a node** with $c$ edges connected to existing nodes with **preferential attachment**.

The probability of attaching to an existing node can be written as:

$$p = \frac{k_i}{\sum_i k_i}$$
