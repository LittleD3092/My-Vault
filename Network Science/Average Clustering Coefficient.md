Average clustering coefficient is an easier way to obtain a value approximately equal to [[Global Clustering Coefficient]]. In fact, in [[Watts-Strogatz Small-world Model]], average clustering coefficient is equal to the [[Global Clustering Coefficient]].

Average clustering coefficient can be obtained by averaging the [[Local Clustering Coefficient]] of every node:

$$C_{\rm WS} = \frac 1 n\sum_{i = 1}^n C_i$$
