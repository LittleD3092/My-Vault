Incidence matrix is a mathematical way of representing the **connections between 2 classes of objects**.

# Example

For example, the following [[Hyper Graph|hyper graph]] and [[Bipartite Graph|bipartite graph]]

![[Pasted image 20230919213130.png|400]]

have incidence matrix:

- 1 of the classes represents rows, and the other represents columns.

# Incidence Matrix of General Graphs

- Incidence matrix can also be constructed using **general graphs**.
- In this case, **edges** are a class and **vertices** are the other class.

Below represent weighted and unweighted graph:

| Unweighted                                | Weighted                                  |

# One-Mode Projection

[[One-Mode Projection|One-mode projection]] creates an [[Adjacency Matrices|adjacency matrix]] that represent the 2-step connection of the network.
