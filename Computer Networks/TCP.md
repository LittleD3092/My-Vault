The TCP service model includes a connection-oriented service and a reliable data transfer service.

- Connection-oriented service.
	- TCP has the client and server exchange transport-layer control information with each other before the application-level messages begin to flow. This is called handshaking procedure.
	- After handshaking, a ==TCP connection== is established between the sockets of the two processes.
- Reliable data transfer service.
	- The communicating processes can rely on TCP to deliver all data sent without error and in the proper order.
