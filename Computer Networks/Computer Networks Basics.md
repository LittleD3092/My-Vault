# Internet

![[internet components - computer networks basics.jpg]]

The internet is consisted with four things:

- Devices
	- Hosts, also known as end systems.
	- This may be personal computer, may be a server.
- Packet switches
	- Consisted of routers and switches.
	- Act as a cross section, connect communication links together.
- Communication links
	- A line of communication, can be made of fiber, copper, radio or satellite.
	- The form of communication links determines the bandwidth.
- Networks
	- A collection of devices, routers and links managed by an organization.
	- eg. A home network, data center network, Taiwan Acadamic Network.

The internet is basically a network of smaller networks.

## Protocols

The devices need a way of communicating with others, this communication method is called protocols. Protocols control sending and receiving of messages. All communication activities in internet are governed by protocols.

Protocols define the format, order of messages sent and received among network entities, and actions taken on message transmission and receipt.

Some common protocols:

- http
- streaming video
- skype
- TCP
- IP
- wifi
- 4G
- Ethernet

## Access Networks

### Cable-Based Access

The cable-based access is usually established using the television cable. DIfferent homes shares a cable, therefore one's internet bandwidth is dependent on whether others is using the cable too.

One cable can be splitted to different channels by frequency. In this way, the bandwidth will be larger. This technology is called "frequency division multiplexing", "FDM".

### Digital Subscriber Line (DSL)

The DSL access is usually established using telephone cables. Each house has a dedicated cable, therefore your bandwidth does not share with other houses.

### Home Networks

### Enterprise Networks

![[enterprise networks - computer networks basics.png]]

This kind of networks is used in companies and universities, places that need both wireless and wired access, also have a wide range.

Enterprise networks are mixed of wired, wireless link technologies, and connects a mix of switches and routes.

## Wireless Access Networks

### Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs)

Wifi is this type of networks. This network has a very short range, but the speed is better than [[#Wide-Area Cellular Access Networks]].

### Wide-Area Cellular Access Networks

![[wide-area cellular access networks.png]]

This kind of networks is provided by mobile or cellular network operator. 4G cellular networks is this type of network.

Wide-area cellular access networks have higher range than [[#Wireless Local Area Networks WLANs]], however the bandwidth is smaller.
