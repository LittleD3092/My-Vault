Edges of the Internet are the computers and other devices connected to the Internet. They are called ==hosts== or ==end systems==.

Hosts are further divided into two categories:

1. ==clients==: desktops, laptops, smartphones.
2. ==servers==: powerful machines that store and distribute Web pages, stream video, relay e-mail. Today, most servers are in large ==data centers==.
