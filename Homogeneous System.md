A system of linear equations is said to be homogeneous if the constants on the right-hand side are all zero. The following [[Augmented Matrix]] is an example.

$$\left[
	\begin{array}{}
		-1 & 1 & -1 & 3 \\
		3 & 1 & -1 & -1 \\
		2 & -1 & -2 & -1
	\end{array}
\right\vert
\left.
	\begin{array}{}
		0 \\
		0 \\
		0
	\end{array}
\right]$$

- Homogeneous system are always consistent since it must have the trivial solution $(0, 0, \dots, 0)$.
- An $m \times n$ homogeneous system has a nontrivial solution if $n > m$. (underdetermined)
