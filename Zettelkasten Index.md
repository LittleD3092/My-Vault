The notes in the main box of [[Slip-box|slip-box system]] each has an index. The indexes do not mean any category, therefore the notes are not organized by topic.

The index is a hierarchy structure, using numbers and alphabets. Like:

```
- 22
	- 22a
- 23
```

The note `22a` is related to note `22`, and may be its sub-content. When the depth of the system is massive, the index may be very long.
