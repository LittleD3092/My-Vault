This "wave" is referred to the waves traveling on a vibrating string, not ocean wave or other wave.

# Modelling

![[modelling a wave equation.png]]

Assumptions:
1. String has uniform density $\rho$
2. The tension from stretching ($T$) is much larger than force of gravity (so ignore gravity)
3. The problem is 1-D. Also, assume $u(x, t)$ is small, so that any point on the string is displaced only vertically.
4. The string has no bending stiffness.
