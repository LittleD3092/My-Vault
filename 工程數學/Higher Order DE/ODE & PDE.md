**ODE**: Ordinary [[Differential Equation]]. Only has one independent variable.
**PDE**: Partial [[Differential Equation]]. Has two or more independent variables.

> Example: 
> $\frac{d^3u}{dx^3} + \frac{d^2u}{dx^2} + \frac{du}{dx} + cos(6x)u = 0$
> This is ODE.

> Example:
> $\frac{\partial^2u}{\partial x^2}+ \frac{\partial^2u}{\partial y^2} = 0$ , $\frac{\partial x}{\partial t} = \frac{\partial y}{\partial t}$
> This is PDE
