Bayes rule defines the relationship of [[Conditioned Probability|conditioned probability]] and its inverse:

$$
\begin{array}{}
	p(x\vert y) &=& 
	\displaystyle\frac{p(y \vert x)p(x)}{p(y)} &=&
	\displaystyle
	\frac{p(y\vert x)p(x)}{\sum_{x'}p(y\vert x')p(x')} & \text{for discrete} \\
	
\end{array}
$$
