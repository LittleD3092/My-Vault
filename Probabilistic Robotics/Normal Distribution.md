A normal distribution has parameters mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$. The distribution can be represented as:

$$p(x) = (2\pi \sigma^2)^{-\frac 1 2} \exp\left(-\frac{1}{2}\frac{(x - \mu)^2}{\sigma^2}\right)$$

- $x$: A scalar.
- $\mu$: Mean.
- $\sigma^2$: Variance.

The distribution can be represented as $\mathcal{N}(x; \mu, \sigma^2)$.
