Resilience means the capacity of a material to absorb energy within its elastic range. The resilience of a material is represented as modulus of resilience, $u_R$.

- $u_R$ is the energy absorbed per unit volume without permanent deformation.
- $u_R$ equals the area of the gray part of the following diagram:

- $u_R$ is calculated using the area before $el$ by definition. But the elastic point is not too easy to measure, therefore yield point $y$ is often used.
