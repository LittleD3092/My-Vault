# 2D

Below is a figure showing the rotation of a point:

We can see that:

$$
\begin{array}{l}
	& \left\{
		\begin{array}{}
			x' &=& r \cos (\phi + \theta) \\
			y' &=& r \sin (\phi + \theta)
		\end{array}
	\right. \\
	\implies & \left\{
		\begin{array}{}
			x' &=& r\sin\theta\cos\phi + r\cos\theta\sin\phi \\
			y' &=& r\cos\theta\cos\phi + r\sin\theta\sin\phi
		\end{array}
	\right. \\
\end{array}
$$
