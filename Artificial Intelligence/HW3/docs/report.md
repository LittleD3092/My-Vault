# Introduction to Artificial Intelligence HW3

## Introduction

- I don't know about any of the concepts now.
- I use `python3.10`, while the specs require `python3.7`. I may need to fix it later.

TODO: The following programs need to be modified in order to complete the homework.

| Folder               | File                      |
| -------------------- | ------------------------- |
| `Adversarial_search` | `multiAgents.py`          |
| `Q-learning`         | `valueIterationAgents.py` |
|                      | `qlearningAgents.py`      |
|                      | `featureExtractors.py`    |
| `DQN`                | `DQN.py`                  |
|                      | `pacmanDQN_Agent.py`      |

## Part 1: Adversarial Search

I thought the `depth` means the number of moves (for both pacman and 2 ghosts to move, the total depth would be `3`), but I was wrong. For pacman and all the ghosts to move once, the depth would be `1`.
