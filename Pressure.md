# Static Fluid

## Incompressible Liquids

We know from [[Fluid Statics]]:

$$
\frac{dp}{dz} = -\rho g \equiv -\gamma
$$

For an incompressible fluid, $\rho = \text{constant}$. Then for constant gravity:

$$\frac{dp}{dz} = -\rho g = \text{constnat}$$

To find out the pressure, we integrate both sides:

$$\int_{p_0}^p dp = -\int_{z_0}^z \rho gdz$$

Therefore we obtain ==the pressure for incompressible liquids==:

$$\underline{p - p_0 = \Delta p = \rho gh}_\#$$
