Shannon's formula specifies the upper bound of the channel capacity. This is the theoretical upper bound of achievable data rate. (<u>1</u>)

$$
C = B\log_2 (1 + {\rm SNR})
$$

- $C$: Channel capacity.
- $B$: Channel bandwidth.
- $\rm SNR$: $E[s^2] / N_0$, the ratio of signal power and the noise power.
