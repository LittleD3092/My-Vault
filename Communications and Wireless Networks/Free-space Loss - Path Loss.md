Free-space loss is the amount of loss through free space (usually air). (<u>1</u>)

The formula is: (<u>1</u>)

$$\frac{P_r}{P_t} = D_tD_r 
\left(
	\frac{\lambda}{4\pi d}
\right)^2 \qquad\text{(in Watt)}$$

- $P_r$: Radio wave power received.
- $P_t$: Radio wave power transmitted.
- $D_t$: Directivity of the transmitting antenna.
- $D_r$: Directivity of the receiving antenna.
- $\lambda$: Signal wavelength.
- $d$: The distance between antennas.
