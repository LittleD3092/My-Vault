% scan.m - scan array with given scanning phase
%
% Usage: ascan = scan(a, ps0)
%
% a   = array weights to be scanned (must be row vector)
% ps0 = scanning phase in radians
% 
% ascan = scanned weights (row vector)
%
% notes: multiplies array weights by progressive phase,
%        ascan(n) = a(n) * exp(-j*(n-(N-1)/2)*ps0), n = 0,1,...,N-1 
%        ps0 can be any phase, even outside visible region,
%        STEER is a special case of SCAN, that is, 
%        steer(d, a, ph0) = scan(a, 2*pi*d*cos(ph0))
