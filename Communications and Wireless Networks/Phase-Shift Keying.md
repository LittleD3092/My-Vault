Phase-shift keying modulates the phase of a wave to convey data. (<u>1</u>)

The figure below shows the simplest form, **Binary PSK (BPSK)**: (<u>2</u>)

There are only two useful keying using only phase-shift. Their constellation diagram is shown below:

| BPSK (Binary PSK)                    | QPSK (Quadrature PSK)                |
