Rate adaption algorithms choose the best [[Modulation and Coding Scheme|MCS]] depending on the channel state. (<u>1</u>)

It uses the bit rate and/or bit error rates as performance metric. (<u>2</u>)

Below is a chart for some rate adaption algorithm, categorized by transmitter-based or receiver-based: (<u>3</u>)

|                  | Transmitter-based        | Receiver-based          |
| ---------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| SNR-based        |                          | [[RBAR]], [[OAR]], ESNR |
| ACK-based        | ARF, AARF, ONOE          |                         |
| Throughput-based | [[SampleRate]], [[RRAA]] |                         |
| Partial packet   |                          | ZipTx                   |
| Soft information |                          | SoftRate                |
