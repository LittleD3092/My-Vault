Every normal distribution is a version of [[General Normal Distribution|general normal distribution]]. In fact, [[Notation of Gaussian Distribution|a random variable with Gaussian distribution]] $X$ is formed from standard normal deviate $Z$: (<u>1</u>)

$$X = \sigma Z + \mu$$

The standard normal deviate is therefore a [[Gaussian Distribution|Gaussian distribution]] with mean $\mu = 0$ and standard deviation $\sigma = 1$. (<u>1</u>)

$$Z\sim \mathcal N (0, 1)$$

The [[Variance|variance]] $\sigma^2$ of standard normal deviate is therefore: (<u>1</u>)

$$\sigma^2 = 1$$
