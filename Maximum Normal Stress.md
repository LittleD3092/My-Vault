The maximum-normal-stress theory states that *failure occurs whenever one of the three principal stresses equals or exceeds the strength*.

We arrange the principal stresses for a general stress state in the ordered form $\sigma_1 \geq \sigma_2 \geq \sigma_3$. This theory predicts that failure occurs whenever:

$$\sigma_1 \geq S_{ut} \qquad \text{or} \qquad \sigma_3 \leq -S_{uc}$$

For plane stress, with the principal stresses given, with $\sigma_A \geq -\sigma_B$, the above equation can be written as

$$\sigma_A \geq S_{ut} \qquad \text{or} \qquad \sigma_B \leq -S_{uc}$$

The above equation can be converted to design equations:

$$\sigma_A = \frac{S_{ut}}{n} \qquad \text{or} \qquad \sigma_B = -\frac{S_{uc}}{n}$$

The failure envelope is as follows:
