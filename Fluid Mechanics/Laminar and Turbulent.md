When you turn on a faucet at a very low rate, the water will flow out very smoothly. This is ==laminar==.
When you turn on a faucet at a very high rate, the water will flow out like a chaos. This is ==turbulent==.

A laminar flow is the flow which the fluid particles move in smooth layers. 
A turbulant flow is one in which the fluid particles rapidly mix as they move along due to random three-dimensional velocity fluctuations.

For example, when we design the pipe, we wish to have laminar flow because turbulant flow has greater friction.
But in the blood vessels case, we wish to have turbulant flow to randomly mix the blood and exchange oxygen and other nutrients.

- Laminar: [[Reynolds Number]] below 2300.
- Turbulent: [[Reynolds Number]] above 4000.
