# Steady Flow

When the properties of the fluid at every point in a flow field do not change with time, we say the fluid has steady flow.

$$\frac{\partial \eta}{\partial t} = 0, \qquad \eta \text{ represents any fluid property}$$

# Fluid as a Continuum

The field representation is given by $\rho(x, y, z, t)$.

There are four lines that can represent the fluid flow:

- Timelines: lines formed by adjacent fluid particles at a given constant
- Pathlines: the actual path travelled by an individual fluid particle over some time interval.
- Streaklines: lines joining different particles passing through a point
- Streamlines: lines that at a given instant are tangent to the direction of flow at every point in the flow field.

When the fluid is in [[#Steady Flow]], the four lines are identical.

# Specific Gravity

An alternative way of representing the density is to compare the density with water. The value showing the relationship between the density of a substance and the density of water is called ==specific gravity==, expressed as:

$$SG = \frac \rho {\rho_{\text H_2 \text O}}$$

# Specific Weight

The specific weight is another useful material property. It is defined as the weight of a substance per unit volume and given as

$$\gamma = \frac{mg}{V}$$

Can also be represented as:

$$\implies \gamma = \rho g$$
