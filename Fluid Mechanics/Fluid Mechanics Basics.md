# Basic Equations

The fluid mechanics have 5 basic laws included. The five laws are applicable to any fluid.

1. The conservation of mass: The mass of a system is constant by definition.
3. Newton's second law of motion (also termed the principle of linear momentum): The net force acting on a system is directly proportional to the product of the system times its acceleration.
4. The principle of angular momentum: The net torque acting on a system is equal to the rate of change of angular momentum of the system.
5. The first law of thermodynamics: The change is stored energy of a system equals the net energy added to the system as heat and work.
6. The second law of thermodynamics: The entropy of any isolated system cannot decrease during any process between equilibrium states.

# Steady Flow

When the properties of the fluid at every point in a flow field do not change with time, we say the fluid has steady flow.

$$\frac{\partial \eta}{\partial t} = 0, \qquad \eta \text{ represents any fluid property}$$

# Fluid as a Continuum

See [[Continuum Lines]].

# Stress Field

See [[Stress Field]].

# Specific Gravity

An alternative way of representing the density is to compare the density with water. The value showing the relationship between the density of a substance and the density of water is called ==specific gravity==, expressed as:

$$SG = \frac \rho {\rho_{\text H_2 \text O}}$$

# Specific Weight

The specific weight is another useful material property. It is defined as the weight of a substance per unit volume and given as

$$\gamma = \frac{mg}{V}$$

Can also be represented as:

$$\implies \gamma = \rho g$$

# Viscosity

# Fluid in Motion

There are two ways of examining a flowing fluid:

1. [[#Integral Form for Control Volume]]: Study a region of space.
2. [[#Differential Analysis]]: Study the motion of an individual fluid particle.

## Integral Form for Control Volume

See [[Control Volume]].
