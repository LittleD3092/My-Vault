The speed of sound in an ideal gas is given by the relationship:

$$v_{\text{sound}} = \sqrt{\frac{\gamma RT}{M}}$$

- $\gamma$: adiabatic constant, for air is $1.4$
- $R$: gas constant, $8.314 \text{J}/\text{mol} \cdot \text K$
- $M$: molecular mass of gas, for dry air is $0.02895 \text{kg} \cdot \text m/\text{mol}$
- $T$: absolute temperature
